The Grinder statistics API.

<p>Statistics are attributes of the test results that appear in the
console and the data logs. Scripts can use this API to:
<ul>
<li>report custom statistics;</li>
<li>register additional views of standard and custom statistics.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>This API is for advanced scripts. Scripts that simply need to query
or update the standard statistics (number of errors, test time
and so on) can do so using the {@link net.grinder.script.Statistics}
script API.</p>
