/**
 * Script statistics reporting API.
 *
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this interface can be obtained using {@link
 * Grinder.ScriptContext#getStatistics}. This can be used in a script to query
 * the result of the last test. For example:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 *       result1 = test1.doSomething()
 *       timeTaken1 = grinder.statistics.time
 *
 *       if grinder.statistics.success:
 *         # ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, test statistics reports are automatically sent to the console and
 * data log when the test implementation returns to the script, so the script
 * cannot modify the test statistics. By using {@link #setDelayReports},
 * scripts can turn off this automatic reporting for the current worker thread.
 * Having done this, the script can modify or set the statistics before they are
 * sent to the log and the console. The statistics reports are sent at a later
 * time as described in {@link #setDelayReports}below. For example:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 *       grinder.statistics.delayReports = 1
 *
 *       result1 = test1.doSomething()
 *
 *       if isFailed(result1):
 *
 *          # Mark test as failure. The appropriate failure detection
 *          # depends on the type of test.
 *         grinder.statistics.success = 0
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is possible to set the statistics from within test implementation itself.
 * This is more useful for user statistics than for the standard statistics (e.g
 * <em>untimedTests</em>,<em>errors</em>) as the standard statistics may
 * be overridden by The Grinder engine when the test finishes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>For a list of the standard statistics, see {@link StatisticsIndexMap}.
 *
 * <p>
 * There is currently no script interface for updating sample statistics.
 * Currently the only sample statistic is <em>timedTests</em>.
 * </p>
