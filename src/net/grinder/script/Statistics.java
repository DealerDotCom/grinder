 * The following table lists the statistics provided by The Grinder. Each
 * statistic has a unique name. Basic statistics either hold <em>long</em>
 * integer values or <em>double</em> floating-point values. Sample statistics
 * are a special type of statistic that hold aggregate information about a
 * series of long or double sample values; specifically <em>count</em> (number
 * of samples), <em>sum</em> (total of all sample values), and sample
 * <em>variance</em>.
 * </p>

 *
 * <p>
 * The methods of the {@link Statistics} interface update or return statistics
 * for a single test. Consequentially, the statistics should be interpreted as
 * follows when using this interface.

 *

 *
 * <p>
 * The Grinder updates the statistics for each test just before it is recorded
 * as follows:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>If <em>errors</em> is <code>0</code>, the elapsed time of the test is
 * added to the <em>timedTests</em> sample statistic.</li>
 * <li>If <em>errors</em> is not <code>0</code>, the <em>timedTests</em>
 * and <em>untimedTests</em> statistics are reset to zero, and <em>errors</em>
 * is set to <code>1</code>.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If the <code>grinder.reportTimesToConsole</code> property (see <a
 * href="http://grinder.sourceforge.net/g3/properties.html">The Grinder manual
 * </a>) is <code>false</code>,  the statistics sent to the console are further
 * modified by setting <em>untimedTests</em> to the count of the
 * <em>timedTests</em> statistic, and resetting <em>timedTests</em>.</p>
 *
 * <h4>HTTP Plug-in Statistics</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * The HTTP plug-in adds a number of basic long statistics. Although these will
 * be updated for a single test, many HTTP requests might be wrapped in that
 * test. Where there is more than one HTTP request, the statistic values will
 * reflect the sum for all requests unless otherwise stated.
 * </p>
 *
 * <blockquote> <table class="table">
 * <tr>
 * <th>Name</th>
 * <th>Type</th>
 * <th>Description</th>
 * </tr>
 *

 *
 * <h2>Querying statistics</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getDouble(String)} and {@link #getLong(String)} provide basic
 * statistics about the current or last test performed by the calling worker
 * thread. There is also {@link #getSuccess()}, which is equivalent to
 * <code>getLong("errors") != 0</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example of querying the result of a test:
 * </p>
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * result1 = test1.doSomething()
 *
 * if grinder.statistics.success and \
 *   grinder.statistics.getLong(&quot;httpplugin.responseStatus&quot;) == 200:
 *   # ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * If called from within code wrapped by a {@link Test} proxy, the query methods
 * provide information about the test in progress. This information may be
 * partially complete. Otherwise, the query methods provide information about
 * the last test performed by the calling worker thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are no general methods to access the count, sum, and variance of sample
 * statistics. There is a single <em>timedTests</em> sample statistic, and
 * these terms aren't that meaningful for a single test. Instead, the time of
 * the last test (or the elapsed time of the current test) can be obtained with
 * {@link #getTime()}, and {@link #getSuccess()} returns whether the test was
 * successful or not.
 *
 * <p>
 * There's a subtle difference between the sum of <em>timedTests</em> and the
 * result of {@link #getTime()}. {@link #getTime()} always returns the time
 * taken by the test, even if the test was an error and the time will not be
 * added to <em>timedTests</em>. This allows the script to access the time
 * taken by a failed test, even though it's not recorded anywhere else.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <h2>Updating statistics</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following methods allow basic statistics to be updated.
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #setSuccess(boolean)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setLong(String, long)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setDouble(String, double)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #addLong(String, long)}
 * <li>{@link #addDouble(String, double)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The only way to influence the <em>timedTests</em> sample statistic is to
 * mark the test as an error.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, test statistics reports are automatically sent to the console and
 * data log when the test proxy call completes, so the script cannot modify the
 * test statistics after the call. Scripts can turn off this automatic reporting
 * for the current worker thread by using {@link #setDelayReports}. Having done
 * so, the script can modify or set the statistics before they are sent to the
 * log and the console. The statistics reports are sent at a later time as
 * described in {@link #setDelayReports}. For example:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * grinder.statistics.delayReports = 1
 *
 * result1 = test1.doSomething()
 *
 * if isFailed(result1):
 *   # Mark test as failure. The appropriate failure detection
 *   # depends on the type of test.
 *   grinder.statistics.success = 0
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to set the statistics from within test implementation
 * itself. This is more useful for user statistics than for the standard
 * statistics (e.g. <em>untimedTests</em>, <em>errors</em>) as the
 * standard statistics may be overridden by The Grinder engine when the test
 * finishes as described above.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Registering new expressions</h2>
 *
 * New statistics expressions for the console and the data log can be registered
 * using {@link #registerSummaryExpression(String, String)} and
 * {@link #registerDataLogExpression(String, String)}.
