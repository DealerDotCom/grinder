     * the request takes priority over any default values set by this
     * method, which in turn takes priority over any built-in default
     * values. A different way of looking at it is that we start off
     * with a list of all headers specified with the request, then add
     * any default headers set by this method which aren't already in
     * our list, and finally add any built-in headers which aren't yet
     * in the list. There is one exception to this rule:
     * <code>Content-length</code> header is always ignored; and when
     * posting form-data any <code>Content-type</code> is ignored in
     * favor of the built-in
     * <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> (however it will
     * be overriden by any content-type header specified as part of
     * the request).</p>
     *
     * <p>Typical headers you might want to set here are
     * <code>Accept</code> and its <code>Accept-*</code> relatives,
     * <code>Connection</code>, <code>From</code>,
     * <code>User-Agent</code>, etc.</p>

     * request made.</p>

     * <p>When a timeout expires the operation will throw an
     * <code>InterruptedIOException</code>.</p>

     * doing the host name translation and establishing the connection with

     *
     * <P>The timeout also influences the reading of the response
     * headers. However, it does not specify a how long, for example,
     * {@link HTTPClient.HTTPResponse#getStatusCode} may take, as
     * might be assumed. Instead it specifies how long a read on the
     * socket may take. If the response dribbles in slowly with
     * packets arriving quicker than the timeout then the method will
     * complete normally. I.e. the exception is only thrown if nothing
     * arrives on the socket for the specified time. Furthermore, the
     * timeout only influences the reading of the headers, not the
     * reading of the body.</p>
