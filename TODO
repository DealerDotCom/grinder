If anyone wants to pick something off this wish list, let me know
first. I prefer unified diff patches. Mail them to
grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net.

The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept patches against
it too :-).

* Bugs

** Sourceforge 691728

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=691728&group_id=18598&atid=118598

Grinder script was auto-generated with TCPProxy, when
creating script typical delay on the user side was 1-10
seconds, however, in the script, there are commands
inserted that make the Grinder to fall asleep even for an
hour, e.g. sleep(4348063)

Apparently fixed?

** Timing

Strange discrepencies between G3 with G2 adapater script and G2.
Initial request (with connection) is quicker, subsequent requests seem
to have an overhead. Can reproduce with a single thread. Need to
investigate what's happening at the packet level.

Suspect discrepency _could_ be due to additional overhead of Jython
causing more contention on my single CPU. Need to profile.

** That EOF and retries thing

** TCP Proxy

Sniffer vs redirection. Think there are some bugs here.

Recording \n's?

When visting xweb.sf.net via proxy and then going back to main page,
the target servers get foobared.

Fix the proxy to record Authorization again. Can use connection ID.
The G2 HTTPClient plugin implementation interprets basicAuthentication
properties wrongly. It first sends a request without the
authentication headers, then catches the 401 and automatically resends
a request with the authentication headers.

* Enhancements

** Ambitious

Measure test variance. This would involve the console broadcasting the
total mean, and then listening for the reported variance.

** Console

*** Script editing

Add file tree control, rooted at root directory.
Allow files to be marked for distribution. Any file.
Automatically detect, and mark, scripts.
When new script is selected, unselect other script.

Extend comms to allow files to be retrieved. Hash and cache at
individual file level. The agent should retrieve the files and store
on disk.

How to send script - multicast is probably not the answer.

**** Plans

Replace jEdit-syntax with new jEdit syntax package when available, if
its license terms are acceptable.

Allow file sets to be saved and loaded.

Allow grinder properties to be set remoteley.

*** Add log panel

Report log messages that currently go to terminal, plus start, stop
test runs etc.

** TCPProxy

TCPProxy should be able to work through proxies.

Change TCP sniffer filters to a stream oriented model. This should
cure another one of the TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording large
outputs with posts? Also, consider having a filter instance pair per
connection.

** HTTP Plugin

Authorisation tear down

HTTP plugin to support "mean time to first byte".

Script support for HTTP "system property" options.

** Scripting

Add per-run statistics. This would also allow number of aborted runs
to be recorded.

Script access to global statistics.

Make 'grinder' a member of an implicit module that gets auto-imported
into the top level script module => you can import the special module
elsewhere.

*** Error reporting

^^ To do this, might have to behave differently with 1 thread vs many.
