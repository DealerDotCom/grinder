If anyone wants to pick something off this wish list, let me know
first. I prefer unified diff patches. Mail them to
grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net.

The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept patches against
it too :-).

* Bugs

** Sourceforge 691728
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=691728&group_id=18598&atid=118598

Grinder script was auto-generated with TCPProxy, when
creating script typical delay on the user side was 1-10
seconds, however, in the script, there are commands
inserted that make the Grinder to fall asleep even for an
hour, e.g. sleep(4348063)

** That EOF and retries thing

** TCP Proxy

Sniffer vs redirection. Think there are some bugs here.

Recording \n's?

When visting xweb.sf.net via proxy and then going back to main page,
the target servers get foobared.

Fix the proxy to record Authorization again. Can use connection ID.
The G2 HTTPClient plugin implementation interprets basicAuthentication
properties wrongly. It first sends a request without the
authentication headers, then catches the 401 and automatically resends
a request with the authentication headers.

* Enhancements

** Ambitious

Measure test variance. This would involve the console broadcasting the
total mean, and then listening for the reported variance.

** Console

*** Update Spanish translation.

*** Add log panel

Report log messages that currently go to terminal, plus start, stop
test runs etc.

** TCPProxy

TCPProxy should be able to work through proxies.

Change TCP sniffer filters to a stream oriented model. This should
cure another one of the TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording large
outputs with posts? Also, consider having a filter instance pair per
connection.

** HTTP Plugin

Authorisation tear down

HTTP plugin to support "mean time to first byte".

** Scripting

Add per-run statistics. This would also allow number of aborted runs
to be recorded.

Script access to global statistics.

^^ To do this, might have to behave differently with 1 thread vs many.


* Build

Incorporate checkstyle.
 Compliant packages:
	net.grinder
	net.grinder.common
	net.grinder.console.model
	net.grinder.engine
	net.grinder.engine.agent
	net.grinder.engine.process
	net.grinder.script
	net.grinder.statistics

Find out how to stop net.grinder.console.swing.TestGraph from
preventing parent process from detecting exit status. Surely
System.exit() is not the answer?


* Documentation

HTTP plug-in.
TCPProxy and G3.

** Examples

Using grinder.properties from scripts.

HTTPS.

Basic authentication.
