[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. Mail them to paston@bea.com. The wish list is part of
the distribution, I'll accept patches against that too :-). The list
is roughly in priority order.]


  TPS is _not_ 1/(average response time). Instead you should be able
  to specify a duration. Each VM should exit after that duration.
  Console should collect the total number of transactions and do the
  calculation. (PhilA is working on this)

  Add ability to engine to have different delays for different
  methods. This will probably involve making yet another change to the 
  grinder.properties format. As an encore, make the TCPSniffer record
  timings.

  Documenatation, in text format. Volunteers please!

  Test harness

  Fix deprecated call in GrinderProcess

  Add option to ignore the first 5 cycles so that hotspot has chance
  to work.

  Print the number of cycles and threads to the console on start up.

  Print the number of cycle it is processing at that moment. This is
  only as a reference, so you can do it for process 0. I would like to
  know how far the benchmark is going, especially if there are 100 or
  1000 cycles.

  In the error messages (error*.log) it would be very helpful to have
  the cycle number in addition to all the info there is already (host,
  jvm, thread, url)

  Minor fixes to build.xml:
	Fix the permissions in the distribution files.
	Just include the current version in distjar target.
	Fix javadoc warnings.
	
  Minor fixes to HttpPluginSnifferFilter:
	Respect charset information.
	Sanity check the processing agains RFC 2616
