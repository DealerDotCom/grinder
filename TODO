[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. Mail them to grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net.
The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept patches against
that too :-). The list is roughly in priority order.]

  Think more deeply about how the HTTP plugin should support dynamic
  query string information generated by the server, if at all.
  Validate this agains WLS form based authentication.

  TPS is _not_ 1/(average response time). Instead you should be able
  to specify a duration. Each VM should exit after that duration.
  Console should collect the total number of transactions and do the
  calculation. (PhilA is working on this)

  More documentation - both user level and javadoc. Volunteers please!

  Write more JUnit tests. 

  Fix deprecated call in GrinderProcess

  Add option to ignore the first 5 cycles so that hotspot has chance
  to work.

  Abstract out a TestScheduler interface to allow other algorithms.
  Add a "random order" algorithm, which might work well with the JUnit
  plugin. Flesh out the API so custom script schedulers can be
  supported.

  Add a switch to the HttpPluginSnifferFilter which specifies the
  initial test number for the output.

  Minor fixes to build.xml:
	Fix the permissions in the distribution files.
	Fix javadoc warnings.
	
  Minor fixes to HttpPluginSnifferFilter:
	Respect charset information.
	Sanity check the processing agains RFC 2616
