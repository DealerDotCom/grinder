[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. Mail them to paston@bea.com. The wish list is part of
the distribution, I'll accept patches against that too :-). The list
is roughly in priority order.]

  Add a JUnit plugin - automatic support for reflection! Use to test
  the Trader EJB.

  Update docs for TCPSniffer etc.

  Think more deeply about how the HTTP plugin should support dynamic
  query string information generated by the server, if at all.
  Validate this agains WLS form based authentication.

  TPS is _not_ 1/(average response time). Instead you should be able
  to specify a duration. Each VM should exit after that duration.
  Console should collect the total number of transactions and do the
  calculation. (PhilA is working on this)

  More documentation. Volunteers please!

  Write more JUnit tests. 

  Fix deprecated call in GrinderProcess

  Add option to ignore the first 5 cycles so that hotspot has chance
  to work.

  Add a switch to the HttpPluginSnifferFilter which specifies the
  initial test number for the output.

  Minor fixes to build.xml:
	Fix the permissions in the distribution files.
	Fix javadoc warnings.
	Add JUnit target. (Then test thyself with the JUnit plugin!)
	
  Minor fixes to HttpPluginSnifferFilter:
	Respect charset information.
	Sanity check the processing agains RFC 2616
