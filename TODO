[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. Mail them to grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net.
The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept patches against
that too :-). The list is roughly in priority order.]

  Add support for HTTP authentication.

  More documentation - both user level and javadoc. Volunteers please!

  Write more JUnit tests. In particular, TestStatisticsMap, new
  console components.

  Add a switch to the HttpPluginSnifferFilter which specifies the
  initial test number for the output.

  Find out how to stop net.grinder.console.swing.TestGraph from
  preventing parent process from detecting exit status. (For example,
  when used with the JUnit plugin). Surely System.exit() is not the
  answer?

  Get the communications tests and the swing tests running under the
  JUnit plugin.

  Add dropped packet detection to the communications.

  Allow String Beans to optionally capture request results. (Would
  invoke "set" methods).

  Print out to terminal that processes are waiting for console to
  start them. Print the current time when they are finally started.

  When run with recordTime=false, shouldn't log time to the data file.

  Minor fixes to build.xml:
	Fix the permissions in the distribution files.
	
  Minor fixes to HttpPluginSnifferFilter:
	Respect charset information.
	Sanity check the processing agains RFC 2616


The following are scheduled for Grinder 3:

  Abstract out a TestScheduler interface to allow other algorithms.
  Add a "random order" algorithm, which might work well with the JUnit
  plugin. Flesh out the API so custom script schedulers can be
  supported.

  Resolve the dependency of the console on a particular configuration
  file. Or use the console to broadcast configuration to the grinder
  processes.

  Replace HttpURLConnection. Either roll our own, or use HTTPClient:
