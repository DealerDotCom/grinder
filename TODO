This is The Grinder TODO list. Its a collection of my thoughts on the
future of The Grinder.

If you want to implement something off this wish list, let me know
first by discussion your ideas on the grinder-development list. There
are instructions on how to contribute at
http://grinder.sourceforge.net/development/contributing.html.

The TODO list is part of the binary distribution. I'll accept patches
against it too :-).

* Enhancements

** Script Distribution

*** Model

Agent process to manage file cache. (Need files as Jython can't have
python path into memory). Agent is responsible for local file store
below a directory based on the agent name.

File cache should be up to date with directory structure below
directory chosen by console. The root directory is part of python
path.

**** Tasks

***** Release 1 (done)

Task: Agent receives asynchronously.
Task: Console to broadcast. Remove ScriptDistributionFiles work.
Task: Allow editing in the console.
Task: DistributeFilesMessage -> DistributeFileMessage (send a single
file). Send in a background thread with a progress bar.
Task: Console to maintain map of remote agent address to last update
time. For now assume that agent cache should be overwritten. For now,
find the oldest time and broadcast since then. Null -> send the lot.
Task: Console to clear cache state on root change -> broadcast full
cache on distribution. Need a special "clear cache" message.
Task: Console to allow selection of script. Warn on distribution if no
script selected.
Task: Agent to receive selection of script.
Task: Agent FileStore to update copy of cache asynchronously. Main
agent thread to move it into place at good point in lifecycle to
prevent locking of stale files by worker processes.
Task: Agent shouldn't create filestore directory until necessary.
Task: Setting a new directory should require agents to refresh their
cache.

***** Release 2 (done)

Task: File Store directory should have a README describing what its
for.
Task: Guard against distributing agent cache directory. Can mark with
a special file - maybe the README? Also prevent distribution of
temporary files, CVS directories, grinder log files.

***** Release 3 (done)

Task: Mature FileDistributionHandler model. Extract from comms
package, leaving the comms bit of it behind.
Task: Model agent cache state.
Task: Console to indicate global dirty state. (Distinct from buffer
"dirty" state).
Task: Console to check dirty state on play and warn.
Task: Console should not enable worker process controls if no agent is
connected.
Task: If dirty buffers on play, optionally warn.

***** Release 4 (done)

Task: Merge worker and agent process status models. Update process tab
to show both.

***** Release 5 (done)

Task: Add warning if saving outside of distribution.
Task: Console to watch local file system for edits, trigger need to distribute.
Task: Regularly update the tree to match file system.
Task: Write some tests for FileTree.
Task: Warnings for buffers whose file is modified outside of editor.

***** Release 6

Task: External editor integration.
Task: The agent should pick up secondary grinder.properties from file
cache.
Task: Console to optionally auto broadcast on play. Need some way of
synchronising before starting run.

***** Release 7

Task: Addressed messaging. Every Acceptor.SocketResource to know its
remote EndPoint. Add FilteredFanOutServerSender (Extend
FanOutServerSender, allow resourceToOutputStream to return null
indicating the resource shouldn't be sent anything. Supplied Filter
method is given a SocketResource and the Message and can then veto.)

Task: Add agent initiation channel so agent can send a checksum across
file names/sizes. Console compares with its cache and generates a good
last update time for the agent. Thus agents starting with a good cache
skip sync. Can't rely on remote timestamps as clocks are not sync'd.

Task: Distribution file filter should be dynamically settable.

** Console

Note: Klaus-Peter Berg is currently working on a major refactoring of
the console.

*** Stop the recording when last thread terminates
Requested by Jürgen Weber

*** Refactoring

Consider moving overwrite / save before close / ... handling to the
model. Needs some kind of command pattern to represent choices.

*** Add log panel

Report log messages that currently go to terminal, plus start, stop
test runs etc. Logs should be timestamped. Use log to replace use of
System.err for warnings.

*** Future editor features

Crtl-S -> save.
Revert file.
Status bar.
Undo.
Copy and Paste menu items.
File tree popup menu.

Allow grinder properties to be set remotely.
- This could just be another view in the editor?

**** jEdit

Replace jEdit-syntax with new jEdit syntax package when available, if
its license terms are acceptable. Apparently now available.

    Clause 2b:

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.


    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
    free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
    to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
    status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
    the sharing and reuse of software generally.

** Engine

There should be an ExternalFilenameFactory, cf ExternalLogger.

Log lines should not be truncated.

*** Interactive mode

Possible to have an interactive mode for debugging? E.g. a simple UI
that can be launched from a thread which drops the user into a
console? Would need to launch with grinder.debug.singleprocess=true.

*** Instrumentation API

Could we support a procedural "startTest()", "stopTest()" API?

Perhaps. This procedural style would certainly be more obvious
to the average user than "wrapping". OTOH, wrapping is powerful
and I'm not sure we want to support two mechanisms to instrument
code.

** Statistics

Total time should distinguish nested tests. Introduce new concept of a
Group Test?

Split out serializeable kernel of TestStatisticsMap? Look hard at where the
message is deserialised.

public ExpressionView ctor should probably be deprecated.

*** Aligning data files

Requested by Jose Antonio Zapata:

Add an additional "milliseconds since the Epoch" entry to the data
files.

*** Separate out console statistics views from summary statistics views

Needed for custom statistics that use 'period' so are valid in the
console but not in the process logs.

*** max(), min()

(Requested by Venelin Mitov).

Should store max, min values agains SampleStatistics, and add max(),
min() to expressions.


** TCPProxy

Change TCPProxy filters to a stream oriented model. This should cure
another one of the TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording large
outputs with posts? Also, consider having a filter instance pair per
connection.

Internationalise messages.

Support different client certificates for proxied connection.

Allow the filters to optionally parse unknown command line options.
They would also then have to be able to contribute to the help text.
This would allow the http plugin to add options to specify a
different filename, and also to specify stdout.

Failed connection events.

** HTTP Plugin

Remove ParseException, ProtocolNotSuppException from public APIs.

Script support for HTTP "system property" options.

Pablo Estades Fernández says:
 > I need to use client cert on TCPProxy to be able to
 > record the test case but also I need to configure
 > grinder workers to run the test case presenting a
 > client cert.

** Scripting

Consider forcing TestRunner to be registered with grinder.

Add per-run statistics. This would also allow number of aborted runs
to be recorded.

Script access to global statistics.

*** Alternate test languages

Should use AOP proxies (probably with CGLIB) to do test instrumentation.
Should support Java, Groovy scripts.

*** Events
Idea from Nurul Choudhury:
 > Event counting - The Jython code can create a named event and fire
 > the event when some condition was met. When the console polls for
 > statistics the events and their count would be sent to the console.

*** Error reporting

To do this, might have to behave differently with 1 thread vs many.

** Reports

Perhaps JasperReports?

** Code

Review use of Kernel. Probably want to share them.

Remove ThreadLocal from RegisteredPlugin.


** Other HTTP/HTML libraries

OK, this amounts to a campaign against HTTPClient!


Reasons for HTTPClient:
  - Its solid, (and not 'alpha' which is the case for
    HttpClient).
  - Its small and comprehensible.
  - It is efficient.
  - Its extremely well written.
  - Its the incumbent.

Reasons for Commons HttpClient:
  - Its actively maintained.
  - It is more modular.
  - It is richer.

Reasons for HttpUnit:
  - nekohtml, parsing support

I prefer HttpClient, HTTPClient over HttpUnit for The Grinder as they
are "closer to the wire".

*** Specific responses to Justin:
 >(no more NVPAIRS

NameValuePair = NVPair # More readable alias

 > or regex's,

But they're lovely!

 > or patching HTTPClient!

In the next beta I'll supply HTTPClient pre-patched for JSSE.

*** Summary
On balance, yes HttpClient looks good and we should use it if it
proves to be efficient. I'll add it to the TODO, but its a significant
change => low priority.

Update (Oct 05): Doubts about HttpClient's scalability:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=8372852&forum_id=2649

We perhaps need to look more closely at parsing support for
functional assertions, but I don't want to lose The Grinder's
efficiency here.

* Bugs

(In addition to those on Sourceforge).

** Console/agent
Each time L&F changes, the saveAs dialog gets another All Files
filter!

** TCPProxy
Should listen on all interfaces if -localhost is not specified.

* Build

How to build clover reports during full build?
 - currently "with.clover" only works if clover is first thing on
 path, we need to do two "compile", "test" runs with different
 classes.dir.
 - could have with ant-call, modify compile, compile-tests, test
 - better to ant ourself?

Include Clover history?

* Documentation

grinder.debug.singleprocess

HTTP plug-in.

Document G2 adapter.

** Examples

HTTPS.

Basic authentication.

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.grinder.user/186

** Forrest TODO

Create back links from javadoc. This isn't trivial, e.g. this:

      <bottom>
  <![CDATA[
  <a class="noborder" href="../whats-new.html"
  target="_top"><img src="../../images/grinder3.jpg"></img></a>
  ]]>
      </bottom>

only works for top level javadoc.

Create menu links to the javadoc.

How to include arbitrary HTML (e.g. for poll forms?)
