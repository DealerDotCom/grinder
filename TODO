[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. Mail them to grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net.
The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept patches against
it too :-). The list is roughly in priority order.]

  TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording large outputs with posts?

  Update HTTPClient to allow multiple servers per client.

  Console controls: add "reset processes"

  Update HTTPClient to measure "time to first byte" and "Time to last
  byte" as an alternitive to implementing timeIncludesTransaction.

  Get HTTPS support working with HTTPClient.

  Do something realistic with the basicAuthenticationRealm for HTTP
  plugin.

  Write more JUnit tests.

  Add a switch to the HttpPluginSnifferFilter which specifies the
  initial test number for the output.

  Find out how to stop net.grinder.console.swing.TestGraph from
  preventing parent process from detecting exit status. (For example,
  when used with the JUnit plugin). Surely System.exit() is not the
  answer?

  Get the communications tests and the swing tests running under the
  JUnit plugin.

  Add dropped packet detection to the communications.

  Allow String Beans to optionally capture request results. (Would
  invoke "set" methods).

  Add an assertion for the expected status code to the HTTP plugin.
  HTTP Plugin "not ok".

  TCPSniffer enhancements: Should be able to use -proxy without HTTP
  plugin. Should be able to use different remote ports.

  Minor fixes to build.xml:
	Fix the permissions in the distribution files.
	
  Minor fixes to HttpPluginSnifferFilter:
	Respect charset information.
	Sanity check the processing against RFC 2616


The following are scheduled for Grinder 3:

  Abstract out a TestScheduler interface to allow other algorithms.
  Add a "random order" algorithm, which might work well with the JUnit
  plugin. Flesh out the API so custom script schedulers can be
  supported.

  Resolve the dependency of the console on a particular configuration
  file. Or use the console to broadcast configuration to the grinder
  processes.
