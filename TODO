If anyone wants to pick something off this wish list, let me know
first. I prefer unified diff patches. Mail them to
grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net.

The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept patches against
it too :-).

* Scripting

Add per-run statistics. This would also allow number of aborted runs
to be recorded.

Script access to global statistics.

** Examples

Using grinder.properties from scripts.

HTTPS.

Basic authentication.

** Error reporting

^^ To do this, might have to behave differently with 1 thread vs many.

* HTTP Plugin

HTTP plugin to support "mean time to first byte".

Authorisation tear down

** TCPProxy filter

Fix the proxy to record Authorization again. Can use connection ID.

The G2 HTTPClient plugin implementation interprets basicAuthentication
properties wrongly. It first sends a request without the
authentication headers, then catches the 401 and automatically resends
a request with the authentication headers.

* TCPProxy

TCPProxy should be able to work through proxies.

Sniffer vs redirection. Think there are some bugs here.

Change TCP sniffer filters to a stream oriented model. This should
cure another one of the TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording large
outputs with posts? Also, consider having a filter instance pair per
connection.

* Bugs?

** TCP Proxy

Recording \n's?

When visting xweb.sf.net via proxy and then going back to main page,
the target servers get foobared.

* Build

Incorporate checkstyle.
 Compliant packages:
	net.grinder
	net.grinder.common
	net.grinder.engine
	net.grinder.engine.agent
	net.grinder.engine.process

Find out how to stop net.grinder.console.swing.TestGraph from
preventing parent process from detecting exit status. (For example,
when used with the JUnit plugin). Surely System.exit() is not the
answer?

* Documentation

Overview process diagram. Animated?
HTTP plug-in.
TCPProxy and G3.

* Ambitious enhancements

Measure test variance. This would involve the console broadcasting the
total mean, and then listening for the reported variance.
