[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. Mail them to grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net.
The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept patches against
that too :-). The list is roughly in priority order.]

  Think more deeply about how the HTTP plugin should support dynamic
  query string information generated by the server, if at all.
  Validate this agains WLS form based authentication.

  More documentation - both user level and javadoc. Volunteers please!

  Write more JUnit tests. In particular, TestStatisticsMap, new
  console components.

  Add option to ignore the first 5 cycles so that hotspot has chance
  to work.

  Abstract out a TestScheduler interface to allow other algorithms.
  Add a "random order" algorithm, which might work well with the JUnit
  plugin. Flesh out the API so custom script schedulers can be
  supported.

  Add a switch to the HttpPluginSnifferFilter which specifies the
  initial test number for the output.

  Sadly HttpURLConnection gives us no way to get at more than one
  Set-Cookie header. Find something better and use it to implement the
  HttpPlugin.

  Find out how to stop net.grinder.console.swing.TestGraph from
  preventing parent process from detecting exit status. (For example,
  when used with the JUnit plugin).

  Change the console Graph to be a historgram.

  Add dropped packet detection to the communications.

  Minor fixes to build.xml:
	Fix the permissions in the distribution files.
	Fix javadoc warnings.
	
  Minor fixes to HttpPluginSnifferFilter:
	Respect charset information.
	Sanity check the processing agains RFC 2616
