[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. Mail them to grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net.
The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept patches against
it too :-). The list is roughly in priority order.]

https plugin and -httpFilter, many file headers :-(. 

  Find out how to stop net.grinder.console.swing.TestGraph from
  preventing parent process from detecting exit status. (For example,
  when used with the JUnit plugin). Surely System.exit() is not the
  answer?

  Add an assertion for the expected status code to the HTTP plugin.
  HTTP Plugin "not ok".

  Change TCP sniffer filters to a stream oriented model. This should
  cure another one of the TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording
  large outputs with posts? Also, consider having a filter instance
  pair per connection.

  Update HTTPClient to support "mean time to first byte".

  Write more JUnit tests.

  TCPSniffer could record 401 iteractions.

  Measure test variance. This would involve the console broadcasting
  the total mean, and then listening for the reported variance.

  Minor fixes to build.xml:
	Fix the permissions in the distribution files.
	
  Alter console and engine to use Timer.scheduleAtFixedRate for more
  accuracy.

The following are under way for Grinder 3:

  Abstract out a TestScheduler interface to allow other algorithms.
  Add a "random order" algorithm, which might work well with the JUnit
  plugin. Flesh out the API so custom script schedulers can be
  supported.

  Use the console to broadcast scripts to grinder processes.
