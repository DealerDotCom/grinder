[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. Mail them to grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net.
The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept patches against
it too :-). The list is roughly in priority order.]

  Change TCP sniffer filters to a stream oriented model. This should
  cure another one of the TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording
  large outputs with posts? Also, consider having a filter instance
  pair per connection.

  Add per-run statistics. This would also allow number of aborted runs
  to be recorded.

  TCPSniffer should be able to work through proxies.

  Update HTTPClient to support "mean time to first byte".

  Write more JUnit tests.

  Measure test variance. This would involve the console broadcasting
  the total mean, and then listening for the reported variance.

  The HTTPClient plugin implementation interprets basicAuthentication
  properties wrongly. It first sends a request without the
  authentication headers, then catches the 401 and automatically
  resends a request with the authentication headers.
	- Need to fix the sniffer to record Authorization again.

  Find out how to stop net.grinder.console.swing.TestGraph from
  preventing parent process from detecting exit status. (For example,
  when used with the JUnit plugin). Surely System.exit() is not the
  answer?
