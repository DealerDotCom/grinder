[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. Mail them to paston@bea.com. The wish list is part of
the distribution, I'll accept patches against that too :-). The list
is roughly in priority order.]


  TPS is _not_ 1/(average response time). Instead you should be able
  to specify a duration. Each VM should exit after that duration.
  Console should collect the total number of transactions and do the
  calculation. (PhilA is working on this)

  The sniffer servlet probably has to reencode post data before
  writing to file.

  Documenatation, in text format. Volunteers please!

  Test harness

  Fix deprecated call in GrinderProcess

  Add option to ignore the first 5 cycles so that hotspot has chance
  to work.

  Add ability to engine to have different delays for different
  methods. As an encore, make the SnifferServlets record timings.

  Minor fixes to build.xml:
	Fix the permissions in the distribution files.
	Just include the current version in distjar target.
	Optionally build the weblogic dependent classes.
	Fix javadoc warnings.
