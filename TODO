[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept
patches against that too :-). The list is roughly in priority order.]

  TPS is _not_ 1/(average response time). Instead you should be able
  to specify a duration. Each VM should exit after that duration.
  Console should collect the total number of transactions and do the
  calculation.

  Format the statistics. Output them in a separate file. Tidy up other
  output.

  SSL HTTP plugin

  Add i/f so that plugin can control the start and end of the timing of
  instrumented code.

  Build environment - should makefile be part of distribution or not?
  (Effort in making it portable - I've removed the original as it
  was windows specific).

  Documenatation, in text format. Volunteers please!

  Test harness

  Better parsing of the properties file. Perhaps separate out each set
  of cycle parameters into their own properties file.

  Shouldn't need to specify the init method or end methods in the
  cycle list.

  Fix deprecated call in GrinderProcess

  Child VM's should inherit classpath, optionally overridable.
  Similarly, the java.home can be used to infer the vm executable.

  Add option to ignore the first 5 cycles so that hotspot has chance
  to work.

  Separate engine code into interfaces that the plugins use, and
  implementation
