[If anyone wants to pick something of this wish list, I prefer unified
diff patches. Mail them to grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net.
The wish list is part of the distribution, I'll accept patches against
it too :-). The list is roughly in priority order.]

  Add jython to distribution.
  Relase 2.8.4 

  Bug 608392 - localized characters in output files.

  Find out how to stop net.grinder.console.swing.TestGraph from
  preventing parent process from detecting exit status. (For example,
  when used with the JUnit plugin). Surely System.exit() is not the
  answer?

  Add an assertion for the expected status code to the HTTP plugin.
  HTTP Plugin "not ok".

  Change TCP sniffer filters to a stream oriented model. This should
  cure another one of the TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording
  large outputs with posts? Also, consider having a filter instance
  pair per connection.

  TCPSniffer and HTTP plugin should be able to work through proxies.

  Rename TCPSniffer to TCPProxy to reflect reality.

  Update HTTPClient to support "mean time to first byte".

  Philippe Renon notes:
	The JUnitGrinder fails to get the tests from a TestSuite when
	the suite is wrapped by a TestDecorator. The problem is that
	the getTests() method in JUnitPlugin.java does a "instanceof
	TestCase" test. Checking for "instanceof Test" will solve the
	problem.

	TestCase implements both Test and Assert interfaces. The
	grinder will incorrectly fail when encountering a Test class
	that doesn't derive from TestCase.

  Write more JUnit tests.

  Measure test variance. This would involve the console broadcasting
  the total mean, and then listening for the reported variance.

  Tests show that, at least with the NT IP stack, it is quite possible
  to overflow the multicast buffering and hence lose messages. We
  detect this condition and raise error messages, so this doesn't
  concern me from the "correctness perspective", but the communication
  to the console should be changed to be unicast.

  Minor fixes to build.xml:
	Fix the permissions in the distribution files.
	
  Alter console and engine to use Timer.scheduleAtFixedRate for more
  accuracy.

  The HTTPClient plugin implementation interprets basicAuthentication
  properties wrongly. It first sends a request without the
  authentication headers, then catches the 401 and automatically
  resends a request with the authentication headers.

  Tidy up logging of plugin initialisation.
