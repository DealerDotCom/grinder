  <title>The Source</title>

  <p>The <a href="ext:svn">Subversion</a> repository for the source code and the documentation source
  is available for <a href="ext:sourceforge/svn">read-only anonymous access from SourceForge</a>. To check out
  the source code, you'll want to do something like this:
  </p>

  <source>
  $ svn co https://grinder.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/grinder/trunk/source grinder
  </source>

  <p>You can <a href="ext:sourceforge/vcview">browse this repository</a>, and monitor
  changes to the repository via <a href="ext:cia/grinder">CIA</a>. Note, the
  published documentation refers to the latest released version of The Grinder,
  and so can lag Subversion by a month or two.</p>

  <title>What do I need to build The Grinder?</title>

  <p>If you want to build The Grinder from source, you'll need:</p>

  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td><a href="ext:javasoft/j2se14">J2SE 1.4 or higher</a></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="ext:javasoft/j2se15">J2SE 1.5 or higher</a></td>
      <td>To build compile optional J2SE 1.5 specific code</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="ext:jakarta/ant">Apache Jakarta Ant 1.6.2</a></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Later versions of these packages should also work.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
  <title>What do I need to test and package The Grinder?</title>

  <p>The following optional packages are necessary to run The Grinder unit
tests, reports, and release process.</p>

  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td><a href="ext:sourceforge/junit/">JUnit 3.8.1</a></td>
      <td>to run the unit tests</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="ext:checkstyle">Checkstyle 3.4</a></td>
      <td>to check the formatting of changes you may make to The Grinder</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="ext:clover">Clover 1.3.5</a></td>
      <td>to check unit test coverage</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="ext:svnant">svnant 1.0.0</a></td>
      <td>to run the Ant tasks that release The Grinder</td>
    </tr>

  </table>

  <p>Later versions of these packages should also work.</p>

  <title>How to give back</title>

  <p>If you feel you have something worth sharing, please first
  discuss your ideas on the <a
  href="ext:mail/grinder-development">grinder-development list</a>.
  If your ideas develop into code, you can submit patches to this list.
  Patches should be in 'unified diff' (<code>diff -u</code>) format against
  either the latest released version of The Grinder 3, or the Subversion
  trunk (please state which revision). Patches should also
  include updates to the relevant documentation sources. Please
  include a statement in your email  that you, and where appropriate your
  employer, are happy for your work to be distributed under the terms of <a
  href="site:license">The Grinder license</a>.</p>

  <p>Please pay attention to the existing coding style of The Grinder.
  There is a <a href="ext:checkstyle">Checkstyle</a> configuration
  file for The Grinder in <code>etc</code> which you should use to
  check the formatting of your code. You can do this using the
  <code>checkstyle</code> build target. Checkstyle helps to make the
  code readable, catches quite a few silly errors, and makes applying
  patches a much nicer experience. Patches that do not pass the
  Checkstyle rules will be rejected. Whilst we're considering coding
  style, please note that Philip considers abbreviated variable names
  to be evil.</p>

  <p>I have a strong preference for classes that take all the things
  they need as parameters to their constructors (like <a
  href="ext:fowler/constructor-injection">constructor injection</a>),
  and for contracts to be specified in terms of Java interfaces. This
  makes unit testing more powerful, and forces the developer to think
  primarily about the purpose and contract of each class. I actively
  track code coverage, and would expect full JUnit tests for new code.
  I use <a href="ext:cenqua/clover">Clover</a>; you can get a free
  Clover license for development of The Grinder.</p>

  <section id="documentation">
    <title>Documentation help wanted</title>

    <p>Documenation can always be improved. Tutorials and examples from
    users of The Grinder are always welcome. Please mail suggestions,
    corrections, and improvements to the <a href="ext:mail/grinder-development">
    grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net</a> mailing list.</p>

    <p>The CVS repository for The Grinder documentation is public. Authors who
    have made valuable contributions can ask for check-in rights via the
    <a href="ext:mail/grinder-development">grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
    mailing list.</p>

  <section id="translating">
    <title>Internationalisation help wanted</title>

    <p>If you are bilingual you might fancy translating the console
    into a language of your choice. Jose Antonio Zapta Rey did just
    this and produced a Spanish translation.</p>

    <figure src="../images/console-es-g3.png" alt="Console in Spanish"/>

    <p>This translation will be automaically be the default for users
    with their locale set correctly for the Spanish language. If your
    locale is set otherwise and you are curious to try this out,
    specify the Java <code>user.language</code> system property.</p>

<source>
java -Duser.language="es" net.grinder.Console
</source>

    <p>Bertrand Ave produced a translation for French speaking
    users (<code>user.language="fr"</code>), Huibert Alblas
    produced a German translation (<code>user.language="de"</code>),
    and Italian, Polish, Russian, and Chinese translations have since followed.
    </p>

    <section>
      <title>How to provide a translation</title>

      <p>Download and expand the latest source distribution of The
      Grinder. Look in the
      <code>src/net/grinder/console/swingui/resources</code>
      directory. The definition of all English text used by the
      console is contained in the <code>Console.properties</code>
      file. Individual translations are contained in
      <code>Console_XX.properties</code> where XX is the two letter <a
      href="ext:iso-639">ISO 639 language code</a>. For example, the
      Spanish translation is contained in
      <code>Console_es.properties</code>.</p>

      <p>Use a text editor to create a translated file for your
      language of choice. The existing translations will guide you as
      to which properties you need to translate. You should only
      include properties that have translated text. Don't include
      properties such as <code>scriptTab.image</code> that refer to
      images, or properties that refer to logical names such as
      <code>action.menu</code>.</p>

      <p>To test your file before contributing it, place the file in a
      directory structure matching
      <code>src/net/grinder/console/swingui/resources</code> and add
      the directory that contains <code>src</code> to the start of the
      <code>CLASSPATH</code> that you use to start the console. You
      may need to set <code>user.language</code> as described
      above.</p>

      <p>Post your translation to <a
      href="ext:mail/grinder-development">grinder-development
      list</a>. Please also include a statement that you are happy for
      your work to be distributed under the terms of <a
      href="site:license">The Grinder license</a>.</p>
