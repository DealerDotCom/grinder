  <p>Refer to <a href="site:getting-started/processes">
  The Grinder processes</a> for an overview of the various
  processes. This page provides some further details.</p>

  <section id="agent-processes">
    <title>Agent processes</title>

    <p>It is typical to run a single agent process on each load injector
       machine. </p>
    <p>When an agent is started, it attempts to connect to
       the <a href="site:console">console</a>. If it can connect, it will
       wait for a signal from the console before starting worker processes.
       Otherwise, the agent process will start a number of worker processes
       as specified by its local
       <a href="site:properties">grinder.properties</a> file.
    </p>

    <p>If the network connection between the agent and the console is
    terminated, or the console exits, the agent will exit. If you want
    the agent to keep running and try regularly to reconnect to the console,
    use the <code>-daemon</code> command line switch. This might prove useful
    if you register an agent as an operating system service.
    </p>

    <section id="agent-options-summary">
	    <title>Summary of agent process options</title>

	    <p>Most agent options are controlled by the
	    <a href="site:properties">grinder.properties</a> file. You can
	    <a href="site:properties/commandline">set properties on the command line</a>.</p>

	    <table>
	     <tr>
	      <td><code>-daemon [reconnect time]</code></td>

	      <td>If this option is specified on the agent command line, and the
	      connection to the console  cannot be established or the connection is
	      lost, the agent will sleep for a while and then attempt to connect to
	      the console again. The default sleep time is 60 seconds, but this
	      can be controlled by providing a <em>reconnect time</em> in seconds.</td>
	     </tr>
	    </table>

  <section id="worker-processes">
    <title>Worker processes</title>

    <p>Worker processes are started by a controlling agent process. The agent
    process passes each worker a set of <a href="site:properties">properties</a>
    that control its behaviour.</p>
