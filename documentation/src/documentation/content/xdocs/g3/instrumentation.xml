  <title>About Instrumentation</title>

  <p>The Grinder allows a script to mark the parts of the script code
  that should be recorded. This is called <em>instrumentation</em>.
  </p>

  <p>Code is instrumented for a <a href="site:scripts-intro/tests">Test</a>.
  When instrumented code is called, the test's statistics are updated.
  The standard statistics record the time taken, number of calls, and number
  of errors. Advanced scripts can add additional
  <a href="site:g3/statistics">custom statistics</a>.</p>

  <p>Instrumentation can be <em>nested</em>. For example, you might
  instrument a method with Test 1, and the method code might call
  two <code>HTTPRequest</code>s that are instrumented with Test 2
  and Test 3. The code instrumented by Tests 2 and 3 is nested within
  the Test 1 code. The time recorded against the Test 1 will be greater than
  the total time recorded for Tests 2 and 3. It will also
  include any time spent in the function itself, for example calls to
  <code>grinder.sleep()</code>.</p>

  <p>The original (or <em>traditional</em>) instrumentation in The
  Grinder 3 works by extending internal classes of the Jython
  implementation. This approach served The Grinder well for many
  years, but has some significant limitations. The Grinder 3.3
  includes an alternative instrumentation engine, which will become
  the default implementation in a future version of The Grinder.

  <section>
    <title>Traditional Instrumentation</title>

    <p>We've seen an example of using the traditional
    instrumentation in the <a href="site:scripts-intro/tests">introduction</a>.
    To recap, you instrument an object by using a
    <code>Test</code> to create a proxy <em>wrapper</em>. The
    wrapper object then behaves like the original object.
    If we call the wrapper the call will be delegated through to the real
    object, but  additionally the time taken to do the call and the number of
    calls will be recorded against the <code>Test</code>. Here's the example
    code again.</p>

<source class="jython">
from net.grinder.script import Test
from net.grinder.script.Grinder import grinder

test1 = Test(1, "Log method")

# Wrap the info() method with our Test and call the result logWrapper.
logWrapper = test1.wrap(grinder.logger.info)

class TestRunner:
    def __call__(self):
        logWrapper("Hello World")
</source>

    <p>Each time "Hello World" is written to the log file, the time taken
    will be recorded by The Grinder.</p>

    <p>Most types of object can be instrumented.</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
      <td>Java instance</td>
      <td>Each method call made through the wrapper is recorded. Arrays and
      primitive types cannot be instrumented.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
      <td>Jython instance</td>
      <td>Each method call made through the wrapper is recorded.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
      <td>Jython function or method</td>
      <td>Each call of the wrapper is recorded.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
      <td>Java class</td>
      <td>Each call made to the wrapper to construct a new instance of the class
      is recorded. Calls of other static/class methods are not recorded.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
      <td>Jython class</td>
      <td>Jython classes cannot be instrumented.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>As a convenience to the script author, each wrapper provides a
    <code>__test__</code> field that can be used
    to access the test, and a <code>__target__</code> field which
    returns the original, unwrapped object. </p>

  <section id="new-instrumentation">
    <title>New Instrumentation</title>

    <section>
      <title>Motivation - why is a new instrumentation engine required?</title>

      <p>The most serious limitation of the traditional
      instrumentation is that it does not work with Jython 2.5 or
      later. Jython 2.5 significantly changed internal APIs upon which
      The Grinder depends in a manner that prevents the continuation
      of the proxy wrapper approach. The new instrumentation takes a
      different approach using a Java 6 feature, and <a
      href="site:jython-2.5">supports Jython 2.5</a>.</p>

      <p>In addition, the traditional instrumentation is deeply tied
      to Jython. It cannot be used with other scripting languages such
      as <a href="site:clojure">Clojure</a>, nor
      can it be used within Java code called by the script. Both of
      these are possible with the new instrumentation.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Enabling the new instrumentation</title>

      <p>The new instrumentation was first released in The Grinder 3.3. It
      is based on byte code modification, and requires The Grinder to be run
      using a Java
      Virtual Machine that supports transformation of already loaded classes.
      Practically, this means a Java 6 JVM or later. First check you are
      using at least The Grinder 3.3 and a Java 6 JVM.</p>

      <p>When you start an agent process, you will normally see a line
      like this in the <a
      href="site:getting-started/output">worker process log file</a>.</p>

      <source class="text">
      16/11/09 07:49:40 (process paston01-0)  instrumentation agents: traditional Jython instrumenter</source>

      <p>The new instrumentation is enabled by setting the
      <a href="site:properties">grinder.dcrinstrumentation</a> property to
      <code>true</code>. If you start an agent with this property set, the
      line in the log file changes.</p>

      <source class="text">
      16/11/09 08:02:18 (process paston01-0): instrumentation agents:
       byte code transforming instrumenter for Jython 2.1/2.2; byte code transforming instrumenter for Java</source>

      <p>If you see the following line, you should check
      you are using The Grinder 3.3, a Java 6 JVM, and you have set the
      <code>grinder.dcrinstrumentation</code> property.</p>

      <source class="text">
      16/11/09 07:59:42 (process paston01-0): instrumentation agents: NO INSTRUMENTER COULD BE LOADED</source>
    </section>

      <warning>
      The current version of Oracle JRockit has a known bug  (8894099) in
      its implementation of
      <code>java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation.retransformClasses()</code>
      that can cause the same byte code transformation to be applied multiple
      times if instrumentation is applied more than than once for a method.

      <br/>The Grinder instrumentation unit tests will fail under
      JRockit. However, the instrumentation engine is coded defensively and
      the bug should not cause any problem at runtime, other than a very minor
      inefficiency.

      </warning>
    <section id="record-api">
      <title>New API - <code>record()</code>, not <code>wrap()</code></title>

      <p>The traditional instrumenter creates separate <em>wrapper</em> proxy objects,
      and does not modify the instrumented target objects. In contrast, the new
      instrumentation modifies target objects directly. Once an object
      has been instrumented, it cannot be obtained in its original,
      un-instrumented form.</p>

      <p>To reflect this change in behaviour, a new
      <a  href="site:api/Test/record">record</a>
      method has been introduced into the script API. This method does not return
      a value, since there is no separate wrapper. Here's our example script
      rewritten to use <code>record</code>.
      </p>

<source class="jython">
from net.grinder.script import Test
from net.grinder.script.Grinder import grinder

test1 = Test(1, "Log method")

# Instrument the info() method with our Test.
test1.record(grinder.logger.info)

class TestRunner:
    def __call__(self):
        grinder.logger.info("Hello World")
</source>

      <p>The instrumented objects are changed in-place, so the new
      instrumentation provides no way to obtain the original object,
      and no <code>__target__</code>
      reference. Additionally, the <code>__test__</code> reference is not
      supported.</p>

      <p>If you call <a href="site:api/Test/record">record</a> without
      enabling the new instrumentation, an exception will be thrown.
      To allow existing scripts to be reused with the new
      instrumentation, the reverse is not true. That is, <a
      href="site:api/Test/wrap">wrap</a> will use the new
      instrumentation engine if it is enabled. Since <code>wrap</code>
      will return its parameter, and not a separate wrapper object,
      the script may behave differently.</p>

      <p>The Grinder 3.7 adds an overloaded version of <a
      href="site:api/Test/record-filter">record</a> that allows the
      target object to be instrumented selectively.</p>

      <p>Selective instrumentation is useful for instrumenting
      instances of the <a href="site:api/HTTPRequest">HTTPRequest</a>
      class, which has ancilliary methods that typically need to be
      called without affecting test statistics. With the traditional
      instrumentation, this could be avoided through the
      <code>__target__</code> reference. Here's an example of how to
      use selective instrumentation.
      </p>

<source class="jython">
from net.grinder.script import Test
from net.grinder.plugin.http import HTTPRequest
 
test = Test(1, "my test")
 
class GetAndPostFilter(Test.InstrumentationFilter):
  def matches(self, method):
    return method.name in ["GET", "POST"]
 
request = HTTPRequest(url="http://grinder.sourceforge.net")
test.record(request, GetAndPostFilter())
 
class TestRunner:
    def __call__(self):
        # Call to request.GET() is instrumented.
        request.GET()
 
        # Call to request.getUrl() is not instrumented.
        print "Called %s" % request.url
</source>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Supported targets</title>

      <p>A wider range of target objects can be instrumented with the new
      instrumentation engine, and the behaviour for some target types is
      different.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
        <td>Java instance</td>
        <td>Each call to a non-static method is recorded, including calls to
        super classes methods. Arrays cannot be instrumented.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Java class</td>
        <td>Each call made to a constructor or a static method declared by
        the class is recorded. Calls of non-static methods or static methods
        inherited from super classes are not recorded.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Jython instance</td>
        <td>Each call to an instance method is recorded.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Jython function or method</td>
        <td>Each call of the function or method is recorded.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Jython class</td>
        <td>Each call made to the Jython class (i.e. constructor calls) is
        recorded.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Clojure function</td>
        <td>Each call of the function is recorded.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>In addition to the above rules, JVM classes loaded in the
      bootstrap classloader, and classes from The Grinder's
      <code>net.grinder.engine.process</code> implementation package
      cannot be instrumented.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The future</title>

      <p>The new instrumentation engine will become the default
      implementation in The Grinder 3.8, and the <code>wrap</code>
      method will be deprecated and eventually removed.</p>
