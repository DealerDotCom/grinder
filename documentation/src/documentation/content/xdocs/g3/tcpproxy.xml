  <title>The TCPProxy</title>
</header>

<body>
  <p>The TCPProxy is a proxy process that you can place in a TCP
  stream, such as the HTTP connection between your browser and a
  server. It filters the request and response streams, sending the
  results to the terminal window (<code>stdout</code>). You can
  control its behaviour by specifying different filters.</p>

  <figure src="../images/tcpproxy.gif" width="762" height="340"
  alt="The TCPProxy"/>

  <p>The TCPProxy's main purpose is to automatically generate HTTP
  test scripts that can be replayed with The Grinder's HTTP plugin.
  Because the TCPProxy lets you see what's going on at a network level
  it is also very useful as a debugging tool in its own right.</p>

  <section id="starting-tcpproxy">
    <title>Starting the TCPProxy</title>

    <p>You start the TCPProxy with something like:</p>

<source>
CLASSPATH=/opt/grinder/lib/grinder.jar
export CLASSPATH

java net.grinder.TCPProxy
</source>

    <p>Say <code>java net.grinder.TCPProxy -?</code> to get a full
    list of the command line options.</p>

    <p>With no additional options, the TCPProxy will start and display
    the following information:</p>

<source>
Initialising as an HTTP/HTTPS proxy with the parameters:
   Request filters:  EchoFilter
   Response filters: EchoFilter
   Local address:    localhost:8001
Engine initialised, listening on port 8001
</source>

    <p>This indicates that the TCPProxy is listening as an HTTP proxy
    on port <code>8001</code> (the default, but you can change it with
    <code>-localPort</code>).</p>

    <p>The TCPProxy appears to your browser just like any other HTTP
    proxy server, and you can use your browser as normal. If you type
    <code>http://grinder.sourceforge.net</code> into your browser it
    will display The Grinder home page and the TCPProxy will output
    all of the HTTP interactions between the browser and the
    SourceForge site.</p>

    <p>The TCPProxy will proxy both HTTP and HTTPS. See <a
    href="#ssl">below</a> for details on customising the SSL
    configuration.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="BrowserPreparation">
    <title>Preparing the Browser</title>

    <p>You should now set your browser connection
    settings to specify the TCPProxy as the HTTP proxy. In the browser
    options dialog, set the proxy host to be the host on which the
    TCPProxy is running and proxy port to be <code>8001</code>).</p>

    <figure src="../images/proxy-preferences.png" width="562"
    height="462" alt="Browser proxy preferences"/>

  <p>The relevant options dialog can be accessed by the following steps:</p>
  <p><strong>MSIE</strong>: Tools -> Internet Options -> Connections -> Local Area Network Settings. <br />
  <strong>Mozilla/Netscape</strong>: Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced - Proxies.<br />
  <strong>Mozilla/Firefox</strong>: Tools -> Options -> General -> Connection Settings.<br />
  <strong>Opera</strong>: Tools -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Network -> Proxy Servers.</p>
  <p>It is important to remember to remove any "bypass proxy server" or "No Proxy for" settings
  that you might have so that all the traffic flows through the TCPProxy and can
  be captured.</p>

    <note><a href="site:mozilla">Firefox</a> users will find Jeremy
    Gillick's <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/quicksearch.php?q=switchproxy&amp;section=A&amp;application=firefox"><em>SwitchProxy</em></a> extension useful for switching to and
    from the TCPProxy.</note>

  <p>It might also be a good idea to clear out any cache/temporary Internet files that
    might be on your workstation. On the other hand, you might decide not to do
    this if you want to record a script representing a frequent user to your
    site who has images are <a href="site:gfaq/common/http-caching">resources in
    their browser cache</a>. Also for IE users,
    changing the temporary Internet files settings to check for a newer version
    on every visit to a page can be useful.</p>

  <section id="EchoFilter">
    <title>Using the EchoFilter</title>

    <p>The EchoFilter is the default filter used by the TCPProxy if no options are specified
  in the startup command. The EchoFilter outputs the stream activity to the terminal. It
    can be very useful for debugging as described in <a
    href="site:use-the-tcpproxy">this FAQ</a>.</p>

    <p>Bytes that do not have a printable ASCII representation are
    displayed in hexadecimal between square brackets. Here's some

  <section id="HTTPPluginTCPProxyFilter">
    <title>Using the HTTP TCPProxy filters</title>

    <p>You can use the TCPProxy to generate an HTTP script
    suitable for use with The Grinder. The Grinder provides a pair
    of HTTP filters for this purpose. These filters are enabled by the
    <code>-http</code> command line option.</p>

  <p>The first step is to start the TCPProxy with an HTTP filter:</p>

<source>
java net.grinder.TCPProxy -console -http > grinder.py
</source>

  <p>The <code>&gt; grinder.py</code> part of the line sends the script to a
  file called <code>grinder.py</code>.</p>

  <p>The terminal output of the TCPProxy looks like:</p>

<source>
14/03/06 17:04:25 (tcpproxy): Initialising as an HTTP/HTTPS proxy with the
parameters:
   Request filters:    HTTPRequestFilter
   Response filters:   HTTPResponseFilter
   Local address:      localhost:8001
14/03/06 17:04:27 (tcpproxy): Engine initialised, listening on port 8001
</source>

  <p>The console (initiated by <em>-console</em>) displays a simple control window that allows the TCPProxy
   to be shut down cleanly. This is needed because some terminal shells, e.g. Cygwin bash,
   do not allow Java processes to be interrupted cleanly, so filters cannot rely
   on standard shutdown hooks. The console also allows a user to add ad-hoc commentary to the script
   during the recording. The console looks like this:</p>

  <figure src="../images/tcpproxy-console.png" width="503" height="60"
    alt="TCPProxy Console"/>

  <p>The TCPProxy console will be incorporated into the main <a href="site:console">console</a> in
  a future release.</p>

  <p>Set your browser to use the TCPProxy as
  the HTTP proxy as <a href="#BrowserPreparation">described earlier</a>),
  and run through your test scenario on your website.</p>

  <p>Having finished your run through, press "Stop" on the TCPProxy
  console and the generated script will be written to <code>grinder.py</code>.</p>

    <p>The <code>grinder.py</code> file contains headers, requests and
  a logical grouping of requests into pages, of the recorded tests.</p>
    <p>For example, the headers section:</p>

<source>
# The Grinder 3.0-beta29
# HTTP script recorded by TCPProxy at 14-Feb-2006 16:25:38

from net.grinder.script import Test
from net.grinder.script.Grinder import grinder
from net.grinder.plugin.http import HTTPPluginControl, HTTPRequest
from HTTPClient import NVPair
connectionDefaults = HTTPPluginControl.getConnectionDefaults()
httpUtilities = HTTPPluginControl.getHTTPUtilities()

# These definitions at the top level of the file are evaluated once,
# when the worker process is started.

connectionDefaults.defaultHeaders = \
  ( NVPair('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1'),
    NVPair('Accept-Encoding', 'gzip,deflate'),
    NVPair('Accept-Language', 'en-us,en;q=0.5'),
    NVPair('Accept-Charset', 'ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7'), )

headers0= \
  ( NVPair('Accept', 'text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5'), )

headers1= \
  ( NVPair('Accept', 'text/css,*/*;q=0.1'),
    NVPair('Referer', 'http://localhost/'), )

headers2= \
  ( NVPair('Accept', 'text/css,*/*;q=0.1'),
    NVPair('Referer', 'http://localhost/css/product_styles.css'), )

headers3= \
  ( NVPair('Accept', 'image/png,*/*;q=0.5'),
    NVPair('Referer', 'http://localhost/css/colours.css'), )

headers4= \
  ( NVPair('Accept', 'image/png,*/*;q=0.5'),
    NVPair('Referer', 'http://localhost/'), )

#....
</source>

    <p>In the requests section each unique request is captured:</p>

<source>
url0 = 'http://localhost:80'

# Create an HTTPRequest for each request, then replace the
# reference to the HTTPRequest with an instrumented version.
# You can access the unadorned instance using request101.__target__.
request101 = HTTPRequest(url=url0, headers=headers0)
request101 = Test(101, 'GET /').wrap(request101)

request102 = HTTPRequest(url=url0, headers=headers1)
request102 = Test(102, 'GET product_styles.css').wrap(request102)

request103 = HTTPRequest(url=url0, headers=headers2)
request103 = Test(103, 'GET tools.css').wrap(request103)

request104 = HTTPRequest(url=url0, headers=headers2)
request104 = Test(104, 'GET colours.css').wrap(request104)

request105 = HTTPRequest(url=url0, headers=headers2)
request105 = Test(105, 'GET forms.css').wrap(request105)

# ...
</source>

    <p>Finally the TestRunner class. This section groups the requests into
  pages and defines each page as a method, sets sleep interval between requests
  and provides an instrumented method for the return of data from the tests: </p>

<source>
class TestRunner:
  """A TestRunner instance is created for each worker thread."""

  # A method for each recorded page.
  def page1(self):
    """GET / (requests 101-121)."""
    result = request101.GET('/', (),
      ( httpUtilities.basicAuthorizationHeader('user', 'pwd'), ))
    self.token_database = \
      httpUtilities.valueFromBodyURI('database') # 'B'

    grinder.sleep(171)
    request102.GET('/css/product_styles.css', (),
      ( httpUtilities.basicAuthorizationHeader('user', 'pwd'), ))

    grinder.sleep(50)
    request103.GET('/css/tools.css', (),
      ( httpUtilities.basicAuthorizationHeader('user', 'pwd'), ))

    request104.GET('/css/colours.css', (),
      ( httpUtilities.basicAuthorizationHeader('user', 'pwd'), ))

    request105.GET('/css/forms.css', (),
      ( httpUtilities.basicAuthorizationHeader('user', 'pwd'), ))

#.....

    return result

  def page2(self):

#.....

  def __call__(self):
    """This method is called for every run performed by the worker thread."""
    self.page1()      # GET / (requests 101-121)

    grinder.sleep(100)
    self.page2()      # GET logging.html (requests 201-217)

#.....

def instrumentMethod(test, method_name, c=TestRunner):
  """Instrument a method with the given Test."""
  unadorned = getattr(c, method_name)
  import new
  method = new.instancemethod(test.wrap(unadorned), None, c)
  setattr(c, method_name, method)

# Replace each method with an instrumented version.
# You can call the unadorned method using self.page1.__target__().
instrumentMethod(Test(100, 'Page 1'), 'page1')
instrumentMethod(Test(200, 'Page 2'), 'page2')

#.....
</source>

    <p>Once you've recorded your script you have two methods
  that you can use to replay your script:</p>

  <ol>

  <li>You can create a simple
    <a href="site:properties"><code>grinder.properties</code></a>
    file and you can replay the recorded scenario with The Grinder.
    Your properties file should at least set <code>grinder.script</code> to
    <code>grinder.py</code>.</li>

  <li>Alternately you can use the console
  to <a href="site:g3/console/script-tab">distribute your script to an agent
  and set it as the script to run</a>.
  Each agent will still need a simple
  <a href="site:properties"><code>grinder.properties</code></a> file
  containing the console address, though you will not need to set the
  <code>grinder.script</code> property.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The recorded script grinder.py can be edited by hand to suit your needs.</p>

  <section id="Stylesheets">
    <title>Altering the output with custom stylesheet</title>

  <p>The recommended TCPProxy HTTP filter, <em>-http</em>, modifies the output of its request
  and response filters by way of an XLST stylesheet when producing the recorded script.</p>

  <p>The standard/default stylesheet can be found in <code>etc/httpToJythonScript.xsl</code>.
  Replacing the standard stylesheet with one of your own making allows you to
  customise the output of the filter. You shuould pass the file name of your
  custom stylesheet as a command line argument directly after <code>-http</code>.</p>

  <p>If you want to see the intermediate XML model you can use:</p>

<source>java net.grinder.TCPProxy -http etc/httpToXML.xsl -console</source>

  <p>The model confirms to the XML schema <code>etc/tcpproxy-http.xsd</code>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="offset-test-numbers">
  	<title>How to offset test numbers</title>
   <p>
   If sometimes useful to offset test numbers for a test script when
running several different scripts together, perhaps using the
<a href="site:script-gallery/sequence">sequence</a>, or
<a href="site:script-gallery/parallel">parallel</a> examples
from the script gallery. This gives the tests contributed by each script
a distinct range of test numbers, which is important because the test
number uniquely identifies the test in the console and the data logs.</p>

<p>The HTTP TCPProxy
filter doesn't directly support
off-setting test numbers. However, its simple to do in the script.</p>

<p>Edit the recorded script to replace:</p>
<source>
from net.grinder.script import Test
</source>

<p>with:</p>

<source>
from net.grinder.script import Test as StandardTest

def Test(number, description):
    # Adjust the 1000 to the appropriate offset.
    return StandardTest(number + 1000, description)
</source>


<p>This technique doesn't allow different test scripts to be merged together
into one. If you want to do this, you might consider a <a href="#Stylesheets">
custom stylesheet</a>; but be aware that you might also have to alter the
identifiers used for headers, URLs, pages, tokens, and so on.</p>

  </section>

  </section>

  <section id="ssl">
    <title>SSL and HTTPS support</title>

    <p>The TCPProxy has SSL support based on the <a
    href="ext:javasoft/jsse">JSSE</a>. The JSSE is required by The
    Grinder, and is now part of Java 2 Standard Edition 1.4.1, see the
    <a href="site:download">Download page</a> for further details.</p>

    <p>SSL relationships are necessarily point to point. When you
    interpose the TCPProxy in SSL communications between a browser and
    a server you end up with two SSL connections. Each SSL connection
    has its own set of client and server certificates (both of which
    are optional).</p>

    <figure src="../images/tcpproxy-ssl.gif" width="762" height="200"
    alt="TCPProxy and SSL"/>

    <p>The TCPProxy will negotiate appropriate certificates for both
    connections using built-in certificates or in a user-specified
    Java key store. In particular, the TCPProxy needs a self-signed
    server certificate for the connection from the browser. By
    default, the TCPProxy will use a built-in certificate.</p>

    <p>When first establishing a connection, your browser will present
    a warning and confirmation dialog. This is because the built-in
    certificate isn't authorised by any of the certificate authorities
    that the browser trusts. Additionally, the built-in certificate
    authorises <code>localhost</code> so if your server doesn't
    listen at this address the browser will complain. Choose the
    "accept this certificate for this session" option.</p>

    <warning>The Grinder deliberately accelerates SSL initialisation
    by using a random number generator that is seeded with a fixed
    number. This does not hinder SSL communication, but theoretically
    makes it less secure. No guarantee is made as to the
    cryptographic strength of any SSL communication using The
    Grinder.</warning>

    <p>Advanced users can specify their own server certificate for the
    connection from the browser, or add client certificates for the
    connection to the server, using the <code>-keystore</code>,
    <code>-keystorepassword</code>, and <code>-keystoretype</code>
    options. See the J2SE/JSSE documentation for how to set up a key
    store.</p>

    <p>If you fail to provide a key store with a valid server
    certificate (hard to do now The Grinder has a built in
    certificate), you may get a <em>No available certificate
    corresponds to the SSL cipher suites which are enabled</em>
    exception, and your browser may report that it cannot communicate
    as it has no common encryption algorithms. Internet Explorer likes
    to be different. If start the TCPProxy without a valid server
    certificate and then connect through it using Internet Explorer,
    the TCPProxy will report "SSL peer shut down incorrectly. The
    browser will just spin away until it times out. The easiest way to
    provide a server certificate is to copy the <em>testkeys</em> file
    from the <a href="ext:javasoft/jsse-samples">JSSE samples
    distribution</a> and start the proxy using:</p>

<source>
java net.grinder.TCPProxy -keyStore testkeys -keyStorePassword passphrase
</source>
  </section>

  <section id="chained-proxies">
    <title>Using the TCPProxy with other proxies</title>

    <p>The TCPProxy can be used with other HTTP/HTTPS proxies.</p>

    <figure src="../images/tcpproxy-proxy.gif" width="762"
    height="172" alt="Chained proxies"/>

    <p>Use the <code>-httpproxy</code> option to specify the host name
    and port of the proxy. Use the <code>-httpsproxy</code> option if
    your HTTPS proxy requires separate settings.</p>

    <note>The Grinder does not work with NTLM proxies</note>
  </section>

  <section id="port-forwarding-mode">
    <title>Using the TCPProxy as a port forwarder</title>

    <p>It is normally most useful to use the TCPProxy in its HTTP
    Proxy mode as described above.</p>

    <p>When using the TCPProxy as a debugging tool it occasionally is
    useful to use it in <em>port forwarding</em> mode. This mode is
    enabled when one or more of <code>-remotehost</code> and
    <code>-remoteport</code> are specified. In port forwarding mode,
    the TCPProxy simply listens on <code>localhost:localport</code>
    and forwards to <code>remotehost:remoteport</code>.</p>

    <p>To understand why HTTP Proxy mode is usually better than port
    forwarding mode when using a browser, consider what happens if the
    remote server returns a page with an absolute URL link back to
    itself. If you click on the link, the browser will contact the
    server directly, bypassing the TCPProxy. Another disadvantage is
    that you can't use the TCPProxy with more than one remote
    sever.</p>
