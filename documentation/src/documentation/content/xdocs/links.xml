          The Ground Report is a collection of reporting utilities specific to
          The Grinder test tool.

          The tools consist of a reporting database and graphing &amp; report
          utilities based upon jyplot, jFreechart and DocBook written in Jython.

          Grinder Analyzer is a tool that parses log data from The Grinder and
          generates client-side performance graphs. These graphs include
          response time, transactions per second, and network bandwidth used.
          Like The Grinder itself, Grinder Analyzer uses Jython, and the
          excellent JFreechart graphing library.

      <td>Alex Miller says some very nice things about The Grinder.

       <p class="quote">"...I was really pleasantly surprised by everything
       that I found. The Grinder has a fairly clean aesthetic that is hard to
       quantify but makes getting started a pleasant experience. What I found
       the most enjoyable about it was the use of Jython to script the actual
       test activity. <br/>

       ...It is trivial to start up the console and your agents, then have very
       fast modify / run cycles as nothing needs to be restarted. You just
       modify the test in your editor and hit play on the console. This allows
       you to very rapidly whip your test into shape.
       Kind of reminds me of Rails..."</p>

      </td>

      <td>Detailed comparison of The Grinder, JMeter, and Load Runner from Travis Bear.

       <p class="quote">"...I recommended The Grinder as the tool to go forward
       with. It has a simple, clean UI that clearly shows what is going on
       without trying to do too much, and offers great power and simplicity
       with its unique Jython-based scripting approach. Jython allows complex
       scripts to be developed much more rapidly than in more formal languages
       like Java, yet it can access any Java library or class easily, allowing
       us to re-use elements of our existing work."</p>

    <p>One of my consulting services is helping performance analysts
    to set up company-internal blogs on their performance activities
    to help them communicate better with their developers and
    management. As part of my consulting service I can offer usage and
    customization tips on The Grinder and a separate data
    visualization tool to show Grinder test results on their company's
    intranet. Much of this is in the area of test automation and
    mining test results.</p>

    <p>Here's a <a href="ext:anser-e/run6">link</a> which provides
    several example web pages on communicating WebLogic 8.1/Grinder
    testing results. It requires downloading the Java 1.5 plug-in for
    charting Grinder test results.</p>

    <p>I run a mailing list for software testers called <a
    href="ext:swtest-discuss">swtest-discuss</a>. There are a few
    people there (including me) who are interested in talking about
    how people do testing for open source projects. I haven't yet
    found a community of open source testers that cuts across multiple
    tools/applications.</p>

    <p>If you're interested in sharing your experiences in testing
    open source software, please consider joining swtest-discuss, at
    least long enough to see if there's any interest in having an
    on-going forum on this topic. If you do subscribe, please either
    send me a private email or introduce yourself to the list so we
    know you're there.</p>

  <section id="book">
    <title>J2EE Performance Testing</title>

    <p>I'm pleased to announce the availability of <em><a
    href="ext:j2ee-performance-testing">J2EE Performance Testing with
    BEA WebLogic Server</a></em> by Peter Zadrozny, Philip Aston and
    Ted Osborne, originally published by Expert Press and now by
    APress.</p>

    <figure src="images/book-cover.jpg" alt="The Book"/>

    <p>This book uses The Grinder 2 throughout, and indeed was
    responsible for driving the development of many of The Grinder's
    features. The book shows how to performance test complete J2EE
    applications and how to explore key performance issues surrounding
    the most popular J2EE APIs. The performance tests are carried out
    using BEA WebLogic Server&#8482;, but are generally applicable to
    any J2EE application server.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, the book contains in-depth coverage of The
    Grinder 2 including a full user guide and case studies showing how
    to apply The Grinder to real world problems. The testing approach
    is equally applicable when using The Grinder 3.</p>

    <p>Following several requests, I've made the source code for the
    book available from <a href="ext:sourceforge/grinder">The Grinder
    SourceForge page</a>. This source is supplied unsupported and with
    no warranty.</p>
