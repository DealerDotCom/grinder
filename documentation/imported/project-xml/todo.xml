<p>
This is The Grinder TODO list. Its a collection of my thoughts on the future of The Grinder. </p>
<p>
If you want to implement something off this wish list, let me know first by discussion your ideas on the grinder-development list. There are instructions on how to contribute at http://grinder.sourceforge.net/development/contributing.html. </p>
<p>
The TODO list is part of the binary distribution. I'll accept patches against it too :-). </p>

Comments on the API: - </p>
<p>
* For sure there will need to be an ability to retrieve stats, as you mentioned. </p>
<p>
* A file transfer API, or some other configuration management API will be needed so that a centrally managed config, such as might be included in grinder.properties, can be pushed out to the agents. </p>
<p>
* Right now I'm using scripted ssh calls to start the agents on the remote machines.  It would be better if there was a good, generic, cross-platform way the controller/console could initiate a connection to a given agent.  This might mean having the agent process running as a server/service on the agent machine, so that it would always be available. </p>

<section name='Script Distribution' depth='2' id='Script Distribution'>
<section name='Model' depth='3' id='Model'>
<p>
Agent process to manage file cache. (Need files as Jython can't have python path into memory). Agent is responsible for local file store below a directory based on the agent name. </p>
<p>
File cache should be up to date with directory structure below directory chosen by console. The root directory is part of python path. </p>
<section name='Tasks' depth='4' id='Tasks'>
<section name='Release 1 (done)' depth='5' id='Release 1 (done)'>
<p>
Task: Agent receives asynchronously. Task: Console to broadcast. Remove ScriptDistributionFiles work. Task: Allow editing in the console. Task: DistributeFilesMessage -&gt; DistributeFileMessage (send a single file). Send in a background thread with a progress bar. Task: Console to maintain map of remote agent address to last update time. For now assume that agent cache should be overwritten. For now, find the oldest time and broadcast since then. Null -&gt; send the lot. Task: Console to clear cache state on root change -&gt; broadcast full cache on distribution. Need a special "clear cache" message. Task: Console to allow selection of script. Warn on distribution if no script selected. Task: Agent to receive selection of script. Task: Agent FileStore to update copy of cache asynchronously. Main agent thread to move it into place at good point in lifecycle to prevent locking of stale files by worker processes. Task: Agent shouldn't create filestore directory until necessary. Task: Setting a new directory should require agents to refresh their cache. </p>
</section>
<section name='Release 2 (done)' depth='5' id='Release 2 (done)'>
<p>
Task: File Store directory should have a README describing what its for. Task: Guard against distributing agent cache directory. Can mark with a special file - maybe the README? Also prevent distribution of temporary files, CVS directories, grinder log files. </p>
</section>
<section name='Release 3 (done)' depth='5' id='Release 3 (done)'>
<p>
Task: Mature FileDistributionHandler model. Extract from comms package, leaving the comms bit of it behind. Task: Model agent cache state. Task: Console to indicate global dirty state. (Distinct from buffer "dirty" state). Task: Console to check dirty state on play and warn. Task: Console should not enable worker process controls if no agent is connected. Task: If dirty buffers on play, optionally warn. </p>
</section>
<section name='Release 4 (done)' depth='5' id='Release 4 (done)'>
<p>
Task: Merge worker and agent process status models. Update process tab to show both. </p>
</section>
<section name='Release 5 (done)' depth='5' id='Release 5 (done)'>
<p>
Task: Add warning if saving outside of distribution. Task: Console to watch local file system for edits, trigger need to distribute. Task: Regularly update the tree to match file system. Task: Write some tests for FileTree. Task: Warnings for buffers whose file is modified outside of editor. </p>
</section>
<section name='Release 6 (done)' depth='5' id='Release 6 (done)'>
<p>
Task: External editor integration. Task: The agent should pick up secondary grinder.properties from start message. Task: Console to optionally auto broadcast on play. </p>
</section>
<section name='Release 7' depth='5' id='Release 7'>
<p>
Task: Addressed messaging. Every Acceptor.SocketResource to know its remote EndPoint. Add FilteredFanOutServerSender (Extend FanOutServerSender, allow resourceToOutputStream to return null indicating the resource shouldn't be sent anything. Supplied Filter method is given a SocketResource and the Message and can then veto.) </p>
<p>
Task: Add agent initiation channel so agent can send a checksum across file names/sizes. Console compares with its cache and generates a good last update time for the agent. Thus agents starting with a good cache skip sync. Can't rely on remote timestamps as clocks are not sync'd. </p>
<p>
Task: Distribution file filter should be dynamically settable. </p>

<p>
Could we support a procedural "startTest()", "stopTest()" API? </p>

Perhaps. This procedural style would certainly be more obvious to the average user than "wrapping". OTOH, wrapping is powerful and I'm not sure we want to support two mechanisms to instrument code. </p>

Tim McNerney writes: <br/>&gt; Obviously, I could edit the scripts by hand. But I'd like to have <br/>&gt; TCPProxy do this for me. So is there some existing method for doing <br/>&gt; such filtering? Say on target suffix ("filter=.gif,.js,.css") </p>
<p>
Change TCPProxy filters to a stream oriented model. This should cure another one of the TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording large outputs with posts? Also, consider having a filter instance pair per connection. </p>
<p>
Internationalise messages. </p>
<p>
Support different client certificates for proxied connection. </p>
<p>
Meo Bogliolo writes: <br/>&gt; What do You think about adding the possibility to insert remarks <br/>&gt; with the TCPProxy Console? Maybe it's usefull in complex <br/>&gt; navigation... I currently look at think time in the scripts to <br/>&gt; understand when the user "changes" page. </p>
<p>
Allow the filters to optionally parse unknown command line options. They would also then have to be able to contribute to the help text. This would allow the http plugin to add options to specify a different filename, and also to specify stdout. </p>

Failed connection events. </p>

Script support for HTTP "system property" options. </p>

Pablo Estades Fern�ndez says: <br/>&gt; I need to use client cert on TCPProxy to be able to <br/>&gt; record the test case but also I need to configure <br/>&gt; grinder workers to run the test case presenting a <br/>&gt; client cert. </p>

<section name='Scripting' depth='2' id='Scripting'>
<p>
Consider forcing TestRunner to be registered with grinder. </p>
<p>
Add per-run statistics. This would also allow number of aborted runs to be recorded. </p>
<p>
Script access to global statistics. </p>
<section name='Alternate test languages' depth='3' id='Alternate test languages'>
<p>
Should support Java, Groovy scripts. </p>
<p>
Should use AOP proxies to do test instrumentation. CGLib, or raw ASM? </p>
<p>
Blocker: Can't wrap around an existing instance that doesn't have a default constructor. This is a general problem. How to create a new proxy that supports all the methods + interfaces - it clearly needs to extend the target. What if we don't care about implementing the interfaces - just create a proxy that supports the same methods as its delegate? CGLib doesn't appear to support this. </p>
</section>
<section name='Events' depth='3' id='Events'>
<p>
Idea from Nurul Choudhury: <br/>&gt; Event counting - The Jython code can create a named event and fire <br/>&gt; the event when some condition was met. When the console polls for <br/>&gt; statistics the events and their count would be sent to the console. </p>
</section>
<section name='Error reporting' depth='3' id='Error reporting'>
<p>
<br/>&gt; It would be possible for certain classes of error (AttributeError <br/>&gt; being a good example) to spew out just <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;       Unknown attribute GETx at "http.py", line 9 in __call__. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Is this what you're after? </p>
<p>
To do this, might have to behave differently with 1 thread vs many. </p>

<p>
Justin Spears writes: <br/>&gt; I am new to grinder, however I found the built in HTTPClient a <br/>&gt; little lacking in functionality.  I might suggest using <br/>&gt; httpunit (http://httpunit.sourceforge.net) instead.  It <br/>&gt; works well with jython, and has extremely powerful methods <br/>&gt; for handling links, posts, gets, etc. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It uses nekohtml to parse malformed HTML documents into <br/>&gt; valid XML then exposes a useful DOM based on these results. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ... </p>
<p>
OK, this amounts to a campaign against HTTPClient! </p>
<p>
Reasons for HTTPClient: </p>
<ul>
<li>
 Its solid, (and not 'alpha' which is the case for HttpClient). </li>
<li>
 Its small and comprehensible. </li>
<li>
 It is efficient. </li>
<li>
 Its extremely well written. </li>
<li>
 Its the incumbent. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Reasons for Commons HttpClient: </p>
<ul>
<li>
 Its actively maintained. </li>
<li>
 It is more modular. </li>
<li>
 It is richer. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Reasons for HttpUnit: </p>
<ul>
<li>
 nekohtml, parsing support </li>
</ul>
<p>
I prefer HttpClient, HTTPClient over HttpUnit for The Grinder as they are "closer to the wire". </p>
<section name='Summary' depth='3' id='Summary'>
<p>
On balance, yes HttpClient looks good and we should use it if it proves to be efficient. I'll add it to the TODO, but its a significant change =&gt; low priority. </p>
<p>
Update (Oct 05): Doubts about HttpClient's scalability: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=8372852&amp;forum_id=2649 </p>
<p>
We perhaps need to look more closely at parsing support for functional assertions, but I don't want to lose The Grinder's efficiency here. </p>
