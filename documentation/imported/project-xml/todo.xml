This is The Grinder TODO list. Its a collection of my thoughts on the future of The Grinder. </p>
<p>
If you want to implement something off this wish list, let me know first by discussion your ideas on the grinder-development list. There are instructions on how to contribute at http://grinder.sourceforge.net/development/contributing.html. </p>
<p>
The TODO list is part of the binary distribution. I'll accept patches against it too :-). </p>

Comments on the API: - </p>
<p>
* For sure there will need to be an ability to retrieve stats, as you mentioned. </p>
<p>
* A file transfer API, or some other configuration management API will be needed so that a centrally managed config, such as might be included in grinder.properties, can be pushed out to the agents. </p>
<p>
* Right now I'm using scripted ssh calls to start the agents on the remote machines.  It would be better if there was a good, generic, cross-platform way the controller/console could initiate a connection to a given agent.  This might mean having the agent process running as a server/service on the agent machine, so that it would always be available. </p>

<p>
There should be an ExternalFilenameFactory, cf ExternalLogger. </p>
<p>
Support for some sort of "Surrogate task" that is run in a pool of threads and has its own statistics context would be good. </p>
<section name='Interactive mode' depth='3' id='Interactive mode'>
<p>
Possible to have an interactive mode for debugging? E.g. a simple UI that can be launched from a thread which drops the user into a console? Would need to launch with grinder.debug.singleprocess=true. </p>
</section>
<section name='Instrumentation API' depth='3' id='Instrumentation API'>
<p>
Could we support a procedural "startTest()", "stopTest()" API? </p>
<p>
Perhaps. This procedural style would certainly be more obvious to the average user than "wrapping". OTOH, wrapping is powerful and I'm not sure we want to support two mechanisms to instrument code. </p>

<p>
Tim McNerney writes: <br/>&gt; Obviously, I could edit the scripts by hand. But I'd like to have <br/>&gt; TCPProxy do this for me. So is there some existing method for doing <br/>&gt; such filtering? Say on target suffix ("filter=.gif,.js,.css") </p>
<p>
Change TCPProxy filters to a stream oriented model. This should cure another one of the TCPSniffer/HTTPPlugin bug when recording large outputs with posts? Also, consider having a filter instance pair per connection. </p>
<p>
Internationalise messages. </p>
<p>
Support different client certificates for proxied connection. </p>
<p>
Allow the filters to optionally parse unknown command line options. They would also then have to be able to contribute to the help text. This would allow the http plugin to add options to specify a different filename, and also to specify stdout. </p>
<p>
Failed connection events. </p>

<section name='HTTP Plugin' depth='2' id='HTTP Plugin'>
<p>
Remove ParseException, ProtocolNotSuppException from public APIs. </p>
<p>
Script support for HTTP "system property" options. </p>
<p>
Pablo Estades Fern�ndez says: <br/>&gt; I need to use client cert on TCPProxy to be able to <br/>&gt; record the test case but also I need to configure <br/>&gt; grinder workers to run the test case presenting a <br/>&gt; client cert. </p>

<section name='Scripting' depth='2' id='Scripting'>
<p>
Consider forcing TestRunner to be registered with grinder. </p>
<p>
Add per-run statistics. This would also allow number of aborted runs to be recorded. </p>
<p>
Script access to global statistics. </p>
<section name='Alternate test languages' depth='3' id='Alternate test languages'>
<p>
Should support Java, Groovy scripts. </p>
</section>
<section name='Events' depth='3' id='Events'>
<p>
Idea from Nurul Choudhury: <br/>&gt; Event counting - The Jython code can create a named event and fire <br/>&gt; the event when some condition was met. When the console polls for <br/>&gt; statistics the events and their count would be sent to the console. </p>
</section>
<section name='Error reporting' depth='3' id='Error reporting'>
<p>
<br/>&gt; It would be possible for certain classes of error (AttributeError <br/>&gt; being a good example) to spew out just <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;       Unknown attribute GETx at "http.py", line 9 in __call__. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Is this what you're after? </p>
<p>
To do this, might have to behave differently with 1 thread vs many. </p>

<p>
Justin Spears writes: <br/>&gt; I am new to grinder, however I found the built in HTTPClient a <br/>&gt; little lacking in functionality.  I might suggest using <br/>&gt; httpunit (http://httpunit.sourceforge.net) instead.  It <br/>&gt; works well with jython, and has extremely powerful methods <br/>&gt; for handling links, posts, gets, etc. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It uses nekohtml to parse malformed HTML documents into <br/>&gt; valid XML then exposes a useful DOM based on these results. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ... </p>
<p>
OK, this amounts to a campaign against HTTPClient! </p>
<p>
Reasons for HTTPClient: </p>
<ul>
<li>
 Its solid, (and not 'alpha' which is the case for HttpClient). </li>
<li>
 Its small and comprehensible. </li>
<li>
 It is efficient. </li>
<li>
 Its extremely well written. </li>
<li>
 Its the incumbent. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Reasons for Commons HttpClient: </p>
<ul>
<li>
 Its actively maintained. </li>
<li>
 It is more modular. </li>
<li>
 It is richer. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Reasons for HttpUnit: </p>
<ul>
<li>
 nekohtml, parsing support </li>
</ul>
<p>
I prefer HttpClient, HTTPClient over HttpUnit for The Grinder as they are "closer to the wire". </p>
<section name='Summary' depth='3' id='Summary'>
<p>
On balance, yes HttpClient looks good and we should use it if it proves to be efficient. I'll add it to the TODO, but its a significant change =&gt; low priority. </p>
<p>
Update (Oct 05): Doubts about HttpClient's scalability: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=8372852&amp;forum_id=2649 </p>
<p>
We perhaps need to look more closely at parsing support for functional assertions, but I don't want to lose The Grinder's efficiency here. </p>

How to build clover reports during full build? </p>
<ul>
<li>
 currently "with.clover" only works if clover is first thing on path, we need to do two "compile", "test" runs with different classes.dir. </li>
<li>
 could have with ant-call, modify compile, compile-tests, test </li>

 better to ant ourself? </li>
