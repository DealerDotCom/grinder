  The HTTP plugin now automatically follows redirects only if you
  set the property

	grinder.plugin.parameter.followRedirects=true

  The build system is now "smarter" about building things that depend
  on external code. It looks in the CLASSPATH to deterine whether the
  following should be built:

	Servlet dependent code (javax.servlet.ServletContext)

	JSSE dependent code (javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory)

	WLS dependent code (weblogic.t3.srvr.T3Srvr)

	WLS Trader EJB dependent code
	(examples.ejb.basic.statelessSession.Trader)

   The class it looks for is given in parentheses. The upshot of this
   is that you need to ensure your CLASSPATH contains the above
   classes if you want the dependencies to build.

  I've finally got rid of PropsLoader. This entails a few changes to
  properties:

    grinder.jvm.path	-	Specifies the java executable used for
				the child JVMs. Defaults to "java" so
				you do not need to specify this if
				your path is sensible.

    grinder.jvm.classpath -	Use to adjust the classpath used for
				the child VMs. Anything specified here
				will be prepended to the classpath
				used to start the grinder itself.

    grinder.jvm.arguments -	Additional arguments to child JVM's.


  Additionally, grinder.properties does not have to be in your
  classpath anymore. (I know I said this before - I mean it this
  time).

  PeterZ found the data file title line useful so I've reinstated it.

  I'm now using Ant 1.2 as the build engine, and have decided to
  remove Ant from the distrubution. See the build.xml file for more
  information.
