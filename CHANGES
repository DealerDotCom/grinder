Grinder 2.1
-----------

  The plugin interface now has a single "doTest" dispatch interface
  instead of using reflection. This simplifies the writing of generic
  plugins. The "grinder.methods" property has been removed. Instead
  tests are specified by a number of "grinder.testX" properties (where
  test is any number). See README for details.

  The "initial sleep time" has been removed, a "begin cycle sleep
  time" has been added in its place. Individual method sleep times can
  now be specified. All sleep times are now randomly varied according
  to a Normal distribution. See README for details.

  The HttpPluginSnifferFilter has been updated to record sleep times
  and reflect the property format changes.

  The loggin of the HTTP plugin has been improved.

  The output and error log format is now more useful. There was no
  point in displaying the host and process for each line (each process
  gets its own output file). I've added the current cycle and test
  number instead.

  I've removed the "simple" plugin as I got fed up of maintaining it.

  We have our first JUnit test case. We need more.

  The TCPSniffer is now silent about SocketExceptions.

  Renamed "GrinderContext" to more correct "PluginContext". Renamed
  "method" to "test" throughout.


Grinder 2.0
-----------

  "Huh - what happened to the version numbers?": This release of the
  Grinder should be published on http://developer.bea.com/ and its
  logically a "1.0" release. However, Paco's original was released as
  1.6 and I don't want to confuse the public too much as to the latest
  and greatest.


  New TCPSniffer - the SnifferServlets are dead! (Big thanks to Phil
  Dawes for the sweat behind this).


  The HTTP plugin now automatically follows redirects only if you
  set the property

	grinder.plugin.parameter.followRedirects=true

  See the README file for details.


  The build auto-detects what modules to build by checking your
  classpath for classes the module depends on. You may have to unset
  your classpath if this doesn't do what you want. Currently the
  conditionally built modules are:

   HTTP SSL plugin (Needs the JSSE)
   TCPSniffer SSL engine (Needs the JSSE)
   TCPSniffer HTTP plugin filter (Needs Apache Jakarta Regexp)
   WebLogic Server 5.1 Trader EJB plugin (needs WLS Trader EJB)


  Fixed a bug that caused the thread ID to be displayed incorrectly.


  I've added a wrapper class for the Console to the net.grinder
  package. You should now use "java net.grinder.Console" instead of
  "java net.grinder.console.Console". All future "main" classes will
  belong to this package.


Grinder 0.9
-----------

  I've finally got rid of PropsLoader. This entails a few changes to
  properties:

    grinder.jvm.path	-	Specifies the java executable used for
				the child JVMs. Defaults to "java" so
				you do not need to specify this if
				your path is sensible.

    grinder.jvm.classpath -	Use to adjust the classpath used for
				the child VMs. Anything specified here
				will be prepended to the classpath
				used to start the grinder itself.

    grinder.jvm.arguments -	Additional arguments to child JVM's.


  Additionally, grinder.properties does not have to be in your
  classpath anymore. (I know I said this before - I mean it this
  time).

  PeterZ found the data file title line useful so I've reinstated it.

  I'm now using Ant 1.2 as the build engine, and have decided to
  remove Ant from the distrubution. See the build.xml file for more
  information.
