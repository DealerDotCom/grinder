<h1>The Grinder 3</h1>

<p>This page documents things that are planned for The Grinder 3.
There is currently no release date for The Grinder 3. Estimates vary
from four to twelve months based on how much development time Phil
gets.</p>

<h3>Scripting engine</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</jython> scripting engine
will be introduced to address the following.</p>

<h4>Fixed test schedule</h4>

The Grinder 2 is limited in that each worker process executes the
tests in the test script sequentially, in a fixed order. The Grinder 3
will address this using scripting. Plug-ins will be provided for the
TCP Sniffer, which will generate simple test scripts. These can then
be modified to introduce arbitrary branching and looping.

<h4>Dynamic data</h4>

<p>Currently the HTTP plug-in's <a
href="../manual/http-plugin.html#string-bean">string bean</a> feature
provides simple support for requests that contain dynamic data. The
Grinder 3 will provide interfaces that allow the scripting language to
create dynamic requests of arbitrary complexity.</p>

<h4>Checking responses</h4>

<p>There is very limited support in some of the The Grinder 2 plug-ins
for checking the results of tests. The Grinder 3 will make these
results directly available to the test script. This will allow various
test paths to be taken based on the responses returned by the server.</p>

<h3>Test script distribution</h3>

<p>From the Grinder 3 console you will be able to edit test scripts
and then distribute them to the worker processes. It will no longer be
necessary to copy grinder.properties files around or to use a shared
disk.
