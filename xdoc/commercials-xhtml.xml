    <h2>J2EE Performance Testing</h2>

    <p>I'm pleased to announce the availability of <em><a
    href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/159059181X/qid=1064753861/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-5481898-2224815">J2EE
    Performance Testing with BEA WebLogic Server</a></em> by Peter
    Zadrozny, Philip Aston and Ted Osborne, originally published by
    Expert Press and now by APress. 
    </p>

    <p>This book uses The Grinder 2 throughout, and indeed was
    responsible for driving the development of many of The Grinder's
    features. The book shows how to performance test complete J2EE
    applications and how to explore key performance issues surrounding
    the most popular J2EE APIs. The performance tests are carried out
    using BEA WebLogic Server&#8482;, but are generally applicable to
    any J2EE application server.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, the book contains in-depth coverage of The
    Grinder 2 including a full user guide and case studies showing how
    to apply The Grinder to real world problems. The testing approach
    is equally applicable when using The Grinder 3.</p>

    <p>Following several requests, I've made the source code for the
    book available from <a
    href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/grinder">The Grinder
    SourceForge page</a>. This source is supplied unsupported and with
    no warranty.</p>

    <h2>swtest-discuss</h2>

    <p>I run a mailing list for software testers called <a
    href="http://lists.topica.com/lists/swtest-discuss/">swtest-discuss</a>.
    There are a few people there (including me) who are interested in
    talking about how people do testing for open source projects. I
    haven't yet found a community of open source testers that cuts
    across multiple tools/applications.</p>

    <p>If you're interested in sharing your experiences in testing
    open source software, please consider joining swtest-discuss, at
    least long enough to see if there's any interest in having an
    on-going forum on this topic. If you do subscribe, please either
    send me a private email or introduce yourself to the list so we
    know you're there.</p>
