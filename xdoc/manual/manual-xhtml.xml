<h1>The Grinder User Manual</h1>

<p>This user manual is incomplete. Much of the material is still in
note form. It will mature as and when I get time to write more.</p>

<p>In the meantime I refer you to the full tutorial on The Grinder
given in <a href="../book.html">the book</a>. The book contains
complete documentation of the console and is currently the only source
on writing plug-ins for The Grinder.</p>
