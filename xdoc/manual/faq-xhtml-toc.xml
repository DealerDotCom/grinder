<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<toc/>

<h3><a name="name">So its called "<em>The</em> Grinder" then?</a></h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3><a name="strin-beans">How do I simulate different users?</a></h3>

<p>You probably want to use a <a
href="../manual/http-plugin.html#string-bean">String Bean</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="multicast">What do I need to do to set up
multicast?</a></h3>

<p>You must set up multicast if you want to use the console with The
Grinder. It is used to send signals from the Console to the Grinder
processes (start, stop).</p>

<p>Multicast addresses lie in the range <code>224.0.0.0</code> to
<code>239.255.255.255</code>. Ports lie in the range <code>0</code> to
<code>65535</code>. You should ensure that the address and ports you
chose does not clash with other applications running on your LAN. The
example files uses the address <code>228.1.1.1:1234</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
grinder.receiveConsoleSignals=true
grinder.grinderAddress=228.1.1.1
grinder.grinderPort=1234
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>For most modern TCP stacks, e.g Windows 95/98/NT, Linux,
multicast works out of the box.</p>

<p>Under Linux, you may also need to set up the routing table.
Try:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Some Windows VPN clients (e.g Bay Networks Extranet) interfere
with multicast. You may need to disable them.</p>

<h3><a name="multicast-w2k">What do I need to do to set up multicast
under Windows 2000?</a></h3>

<p>With a stand alone Windows 2000 machine, you might experience
similar grief to myself. I found that I could only get multicast to
work if my LAN NIC had a carrier and the MS loop-back adapter is not
installed (or disabled). The following links contain experiences that
tally with mine:</p>

<blockquote><a

http://www.web3d.org/WorkingGroups/vrtp/dis-java-vrml/hypermail/2001/0021.html</a>

http://www.web3d.org/WorkingGroups/vrtp/dis-java-vrml/hypermail/2001/0025.html</a>
</blockquote>

<p>The last of these says:</p>

<blockquote><em>
 I have been looking for a solution for this problem a long time
without success :-( I found several dummy loop-back IP stacks but none
that supports multicast. The solution I have been using is to bring
along a tiny hub and connect my laptop to that hub when doing demos.
Windows is a bit stupid in the way that it only checks if it has a
carrier.
</em></blockquote>

<p>I now use a slightly cheaper/lighter solution; namely I have
cropped a network cable short and twisted my own physical loop-back
adapter. Needless to say, if anyone figures out how to get multicast
working with a stand alone W2K machine, I'm more than interested.</p>

<h3><a name="grinder-vs-loadrunner">How does The Grinder stack up with
a commercial tool like Mercury Interactive's
LoadRunner&#8482;?</a></h3>

<p>Here is an edited version of Tom Braverman's (<a
href="mailto:tom.braverman@bea.com">tom.braverman@bea.com</a>) post to
<a href="mailto:grinder-use@lists.sf.net">grinder-use</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
A few reasons:
<ul>
<li>The Grinder is lightweight

<p>Compared to setting up LoadRunner or some other full featured
tools, The Grinder is trivial to install and get running.</p>
</li>

<li>The Grinder is a <em>programmer's load tester</em>

<p>Too often, programmers defer load testing to some other group
(e.g., QA) and don't test their own components for scalability. The
Grinder is designed for people who understand the code that they're
hitting - it's not just a "black box" with a set of associated
response times.</p>

<p>Since tests can be coded - and not simply scripted, programmers get
to test interior tiers of their application and not just response time
via the user interface.</p>
</li>

<li>The Grinder is free

<p>I'm a consulting professional and I have to come up with solutions
to deadlocks and slowdowns. Sometimes I only have hours to recreate a
problem and then attempt to resolve it. I can't count on my client
having a given load testing tool and many (most?) development teams
don't have any such tool (they defer this type of testing to QA as
mentioned above). I can bring The Grinder in and set it up and apply
load quite quickly.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Summarizing: I don't try and persuade my clients that The
Grinder is a replacement for LoadRunner, etc. I tell them that The
Grinder is for use by the developers and that they'll still want
the QA team to generate scalability metrics using LoadRunner or
some other tool approved for the purpose by management.</p>

<p>Story: One client was attempting to determine scalability based
on LoadRunner. The LoadRunner team - with no understanding at all
of the app - was telling them that some pages were giving response
times of 30 seconds. The project manager knew this was patent BS
since he could hit the enter key on his page and only count to 3 or
4 before the page displayed. The client spent many resource days
attempting to understand LoadRunner numbers. Within a few hours,
The Grinder was up and running and reporting numbers that appeared
to track with the user experience. The Grinder became the gold
standard that the client used to measure LoadRunner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its worth adding to this that many companies <em>are</em> using The
Grinder for production load testing.</p>

<h3><a name="multiple-scripts">Can I run different test scripts against
the same console?</a></h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>The console receives reports and updates the graph based on test
number. Thus it is possible to have different agent processes
running scripts with different test numbers (e.g. one process running
tests 1 to 5 and another running tests 6 to 10)., reporting to the
same console.</p>

<h3><a name="use-the-tcpsniffer">My server works fine with a browser but
has errors when I use the HTTP Plugin?</a></h3>

<p>This is probably down to one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bugs in your server code. Particularly, those due to the way it
handles multiple concurrent requests. Don't be disheartened, you did
good; finding bugs like this is a key reason to use The
Grinder.</p></li>

<li>Differences between the HTTP requests that the browser uses and
those that The Grinder sends.</li>

</ul>

<p>The HTTP Plugin sends requests that will have minor differences
between those that a browser send, but which rarely affect server
behaviour. Its worth knowing how to examine the differences with the
TCPSniffer. First <a href="tcpsniffer.html#http-proxy">set the TCP
Sniffer as a browser proxy</a> and record the output to a file.
Secondly set the TCP Sniffer up in stand alone mode and alter your
<code>grinder.properties</code> so that all requests go via the
TCPSniffer; again record the output to a file. Now grab a coffee and
compare.</p>

<p>If you are testing against multiple servers you will need to use
multiple TCP Sniffers running on different ports. The Grinder doesn't
(yet) support sending requests via an HTTP proxy.</p>


<h3><a name="tcpsniffer-colour-codes">What are all those funny ^[[31
characters in the TCPSniffer output?</a></h3>

<p>Did you use the <code>-colour</code> switch? If so, the TCPSniffer
generates escape codes which work on ANSI compliant terminals and look
very pretty.</p>

<p>For those of you on Windows platforms, this <em>doesn't work</em>
with the <code>CMD.EXE</code> window unless you're using <a
href="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>. (Of course, if you're using
Cygwin you'd use <code>rxvt</code> in preference :-)).</p>

<h3><a name="negative-times">I've seen The Grinder reports negative
transaction times?!</a></h3>

<p>Are you running Linux kernel 2.2.18? Mikael Suokas reports:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In some load situations, on some hardware, older Linux kernels can
generate system times that jump backwards. I have experienced this
problem on one machine (Intel Pentium/150, 128M RAM, Adaptec AHA-2940,
SCSI disks) running the stock Red Hat Linux 7.0 kernel (2.2.16).</p>

<p>The Grinder occasionally reported negative response times in the
-900 to -700 ms range whenever the load became high. Interestingly,
the same OS + kernel version on several other machines never showed
these negative response times. The problem was not Grinder or Java
specific: a C program polling gettimeofday() also showed system time
jumping backwards.</p>

<p>Upgrading to kernel 2.2.19 fixed this issue for me. Since the
release notes for Linux 2.2.18 mention time keeping locking fixes, I
don't think that was a coincidence.</p>

<p>Of course, you should upgrade any 2.2.x kernel to 2.2.19 anyway,
because because of the many security fixes.</p>
