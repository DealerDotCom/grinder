<h3>Process controls</h3>

<p><em>Start processes</em>, <em>Reset processes</em> and <em>Stop
processes</em> send signals to Grinder processes that are listening.
(See <a href="properties.html#grinder.receiveConsoleSignals">
grinder.receiveConsoleSignals</a>, <a
href="properties.html#grinder.grinderAddress">grinder.grinderAddress</a>
and <a
href="properties.html#grinder.grinderPort">grinder.grinderPort</a>.)</p>

<p>Worker processes that are configured to receive console signals go
through three states:</p>

<ol>
<li>Initiated (waiting for a console signal)</li>

<li>Running (performing tests, reporting to console)</li>

<li>Finished (waiting for a console signal)</li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>Start processes</em> control signals to worker processes
that they should move into the running state. Processes that are
already running ignore this signal. Processes that are in the finished
state exit; the agent process will then reread the properties file and
launch new worker processes in the running state.</p>

<p>The <em>Reset processes</em> control signals all the worker
processes to exit. The agent process will then reread the properties
file and launch new worker processes.</p>

<p>The <em>Stop processes</em> control signals all processes to exit.</p>

<p><em>Warning - unless <a
href="properties.html#grinder.appendLog">grinder.appendLog</a> is
true, new worker process logs will overwrite those from previous
runs.</em></p>

<h3>Sample controls</h3>

<p>The sample controls determine how the console captures reports from
the worker processes. capture. It is important to understand that
these control the console behaviour <em>only</em>. For example, they
do not adjust the frequency at which the worker processes send reports
(see <a
href="properties.html#grinder.reportToConsole.interval">grinder.reportToConsole.interval</a>
for that). Additionally, the sample controls do not interact in any
way with the process controls.</p>

<p>The slider controls the period at which the console will take a
<em>sample</em>. This involves adding up all the reports received over
that sample interval and calculating the TPS as (number of
transactions that occurred)/(interval length). It is also the period
at which the console graphs and statistics are updated.</p>

<p>By default, the console discards the first non-zero sample period,
and starts updating the display and calculating totals from the second
sample. A non-zero sample period is one in which an update from a
worker process was received. You can adjust how many non-zero sample
periods the console ignores before starting capture with the
<em>ignore samples</em> text field.</p>

<p>The third control allows you to adjust how many samples the console
will collect before stopping capture.</p>

<p>You can also manually start and stop the sampling with the
<em>Capture statistics</em>/<em>Stop capture</em> control. Use the
<em>Save statistics</em> control to save the current set of statistics
to a file.</p>
