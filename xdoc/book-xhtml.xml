    <h1>J2EE Performance Testing</h1>

    <p>I'm pleased to announce the availability of <em><a
    href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/159059181X/qid=1064753861/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-5481898-2224815">J2EE
    Performance Testing with BEA WebLogic Server</a></em> by Peter
    Zadrozny, Philip Aston and Ted Osborne, originally published by
    Expert Press and now by APress. 
    </p>

    <p>This book uses The Grinder throughout, and indeed was
    responsible for driving the development of many of The Grinder's
    features. The book shows how to performance test complete J2EE
    applications and how to explore key performance issues surrounding
    the most popular J2EE APIs. The performance tests are carried out
    using BEA WebLogic Server&#8482;, but are generally applicable to
    any J2EE application server.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, the book contains in-depth coverage of The
    Grinder including a full user guide and case studies showing how
    to apply The Grinder to real world problems.</p>
