<h1>The Console</h1>

<h3><a name="process-controls">Process controls</a></h3>

<p><em>Start processes</em>, <em>Reset processes</em> and <em>Stop
processes</em> send signals to Grinder processes that are listening.
(See <a href="getting-started.html#grinder.useConsole">
grinder.useConsole</a>, <a
href="getting-started.html#grinder.consoleHost">grinder.consoleHost</a>
and <a
href="getting-started.html#grinder.consolePort">grinder.consolePort</a>.)</p>

<p>Worker processes that are configured to receive console signals go
through three states:</p>

<ol>
<li>Initiated (waiting for a console signal)</li>

<li>Running (performing tests, reporting to console)</li>

<li>Finished (waiting for a console signal)</li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>Start processes</em> control signals to worker processes
that they should move into the running state. Processes that are
already running ignore this signal. Processes that are in the finished
state exit; the agent process will then reread the properties file and
launch new worker processes in the running state.</p>

<p>The <em>Reset processes</em> control signals all the worker
processes to exit. The agent process will then reread the properties
file and launch new worker processes.</p>

<p>The <em>Stop processes</em> control signals all processes,
including the agent processes, to exit. You usually want to use
<em>Reset processes</em> instead.</p>

<p><em><strong>Warning</strong> - Each time the worker processes run,
they generate a new set of logs. Logs from previous runs are
"archived" by renaming them. The number of logs that are kept from
previous runs can be controlled with <a
href="getting-started.html#grinder.numberOfOldLogs">
grinder.numberOfOldLogs</a>.</em></p>

<h3>Sample controls</h3>

<p>The sample controls determine how the console captures reports from
the worker processes. capture. It is important to understand that
these only control the console behaviour. For example, they do not
adjust the frequency at which the worker processes send reports (see
<a
href="getting-started.html#grinder.reportToConsole.interval">grinder.reportToConsole.interval</a>
for that). Additionally, the sample controls do not interact in any
way with the process controls.</p>

<p>The slider controls the period at which the console will take a
<em>sample</em>. This involves adding up all the reports received over
that sample interval and calculating the TPS as (number of
transactions that occurred)/(interval length). It is also the period
at which the console graphs and statistics are updated.</p>

<p>By default, the console discards the first non-zero sample period,
and starts updating the display and calculating totals from the second
sample. A non-zero sample period is one in which an update from a
worker process was received. You can adjust how many non-zero sample
periods the console ignores before starting capture with the
<em>ignore samples</em> text field.</p>

<p>The third control allows you to adjust how many samples the console
will collect before stopping capture.</p>

<p>You can also manually start and stop the sampling with the
<em>Capture statistics</em>/<em>Stop capture</em> control. Use the
<em>Save statistics</em> control to save the current set of statistics
to a file.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>

<p>The colours are based on the relative response time. Long response
times are more red, short response times are more yellow. This acts as
an eye-catcher, allowing expensive tests to be easily spotted.</p>

<h3>Internationalisation help wanted</h3>
