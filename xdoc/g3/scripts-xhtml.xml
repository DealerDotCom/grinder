<h2>The Jython distribution and installation</h2>

<p>The Grinder is shipped with a version of Jython but does not
package the Jython distribution of the standard Python library. If you
want to use the standard library, or if you want to use a different
version of Jython, obtain and install Jython and add the
installation's <code>jython.jar</code> to the start of the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> used to launch The Grinder.</p>

<p>Jython picks up user and site preferences from several sources (see
<a
href="http://www.jython.org/???/registry.html">http://www.jython.org/???/registry.html</a>).
A side effect of adding the installed <code>jython.jar</code> to the
start of the <code>CLASSPATH</code> is that <code>python.home</code>
can be correctly determined and the installed registry file will be
used.</p>

<p>One of the most useful things that you can set in the registry is
<code>python.cachedir</code>. This specifies a working directory which
Jython uses to store byte compiled python code. If you do not have
your own installed version of Jython in the <code>CLASSPATH</code>,
the working directory will be created in the directory which you run
The Grinder. This is fine for most casual users; if you are are
terribly worried about preserving disk space, read the information on
the Jython site.</p>
