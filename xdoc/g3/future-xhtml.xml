<h1>The Grinder 3</h1>

<p>This page documents things that are planned for The Grinder 3.
There is currently no release date for these features.</p>

<h3>Test script distribution</h3>

<p>From the Grinder 3 console you will be able to edit test scripts
and then distribute them to the worker processes. It will no longer be
necessary to copy grinder.properties files around or to use a shared
disk.
</p>

<h3>Embeded Agent</h3>

<p>A new agent will be provided that can be loaded within an existing
Java Virtual Machine. This will allow, for example, threads to be
started within an application server which can run test scripts that
make direct calls against local resources such as EJBs.</p>
