<h1>The Grinder 3</h1>

<p>This page documents things that are planned for The Grinder 3.
There are no current release dates for these features.</p>

<h3><a name="TCPProxyUpdate">Automatic HTTP test script
recording</a></h3>

<p>Recording of HTTP test scripts using the TCPProxy, analogous to the
<a href="../manual/tcpsniffer.html#HttpPluginSnifferFilter">automatic
recording of <code>grinder.properties</code></a> in The Grinder 2. A
simplified Jython script will be generated which the user can then
edit. This is a key feature required before The Grinder 3 can move out
of beta release.</p>

<h3>Test script distribution</h3>

<p>From the Grinder 3 console you will be able to edit test scripts
and then distribute them to the worker processes. It will no longer be
necessary to copy grinder.properties files around or to use a shared
disk.
</p>

<h3>Embeded Agent</h3>

<p>A new agent will be provided that can be loaded within an existing
Java Virtual Machine. This will allow, for example, threads to be
started within an application server which can run test scripts that
make direct calls against local resources such as EJBs.</p>
