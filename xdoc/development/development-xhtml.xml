    <h1>Building The Grinder</h1>

    <p>The Grinder is distributed pre-built so you can use it straight
    away. The source code is provided too. If you want to rebuild it
    refer to the instructions in <code>build.xml</code>.</p>

    <p>One day this page will contain more information about the
    internals of The Grinder. Until that day, use the source.</p>
