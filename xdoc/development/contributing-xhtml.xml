    <p>Although the source is freely available for download, The
    Grinder CVS archive is currently not public. Patches are
    individually reviewed and applied by Philip Aston.</p>

    <p>If you feel you have something worth sharing, please send
    patches to the <a
    href="mailto:grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net>grinder-development">grinder-development
    list</a>. Ideally patches should be in 'unified diff' (<code>diff
    -u</code>) format against the latest released version of The
    Grinder 3. Patches should also include updates to the relevant
    documentation sources. Please include a statement that you are
    happy for you work to be distributed under the terms of <a
    href="../license.html">The Grinder license</a>.</p>

    <p>Please pay attention to the existing coding style of The
    Grinder. There is a <a
    href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>
    properties file in <code>etc</code> which you should use to check
    the formatting of your code. (Not all packages are yet compliant,
    but any newly edited files should be). This not only helps to make
    the code readable, but makes applying patches a much nicer
    experience.
