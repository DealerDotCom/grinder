    <p>Although the source is freely available for download, The
    Grinder CVS archive is currently not public. Patches are
    individually reviewed and applied by Philip Aston.</p>

    <p>If you feel you have something worth sharing, please send
    patches to the <a
    href="mailto:grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net">grinder-development
    list</a>. Ideally patches should be in 'unified diff' (<code>diff
    -u</code>) format against the latest released version of The
    Grinder 3. Patches should also include updates to the relevant
    documentation sources. Please include a statement that you are
    happy for your work to be distributed under the terms of <a
    href="../license.html">The Grinder license</a>.</p>

    <p>Please pay attention to the existing coding style of The
    Grinder. There is a <a
    href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>
    configuration file for The Grinder in <code>etc</code> which you
    should use to check the formatting of your code. You can do this
    using the <code>checkstyle</code> build target. Checkstyle helps
    to make the code readable, catches quite a few silly errors, and
    makes applying patches a much nicer experience. I will reject any
    patches that do not pass the Checkstyle rules.
