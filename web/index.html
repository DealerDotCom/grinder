    <h2>What is the Grinder?</h2>

    <p> The Grinder is a simple, pure Java load-testing framework
    released under the GNU Public License. It was originally developed
    for the book "Professional Java 2 Enterprise Edition with BEA
    WebLogic Server" by Paco Gómez and Peter Zadrozny.</p>

    <p>Test client code is written in the form Java "plug-ins". Sample
    plug-ins for testing HTTP services are provided. It is
    particularly suitable for testing BEA WebLogic Server based
    applications.</p>
