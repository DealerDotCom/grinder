    <h2>What is The Grinder?</h2>
  
    <p>The Grinder is a pure Java load-testing framework that is
    freely available under a BSD style open-source license. It was
    originally developed for the book <em>Professional Java 2
    Enterprise Edition with BEA WebLogic Server</em> by Paco
    G&oacute;mez and Peter Zadrozny.</p>

    <p>Philip Aston took ownership of the code and reworked it to
    create <strong>The&nbsp;Grinder&nbsp;2</strong>. Philip continues
    to enhance and maintain The Grinder, and welcomes all
    contributions.</p>

    <h2>The J2EE Performance Testing book</h2>

    <p>I'm pleased to announce the availability of <em><a
    href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904284000/qid=1024655766/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_3/102-8494684-1874510">J2EE
    Performance Testing with BEA WebLogic Server</a></em> by Peter
    Zadrozny, Phil Aston and Ted Osborne, published by Expert Press.
    </p>

    <p>This book uses The Grinder throughout, and indeed was
    responsible for driving the developement of many of The Grinder's
    features. The book shows how to performance test complete J2EE
    applications and how to explore key performance issues surounding
    the most popular J2EE APIs. The performance tests are carried out
    using BEA WebLogic Server, but are generally applicable to any
    J2EE application server.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, the book contains in-depth coverage of The
    Grinder including a full user guide and case studies showing how
    to apply The Grinder to real world problems.</p>
