You should be able to build the Grinder by doing the following:

       1. Set/export JAVA_HOME to point to a JDK

       2. ./build.sh (or build.cmd)

       3. ./build.sh javadoc (or build.cmd javadoc)

If this doesn't work, and your etc/ant directory is empty, you need
the ant 1.1 and xerces 1.2 jars. Either get them yourself, or ask me
<mailto: paston@bea.com> nicely.
