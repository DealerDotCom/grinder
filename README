What is it?
***********

The Grinder is a simple, pure Java load-testing framework released
under the GNU Public License. It was originally developed for the book
"Professional Java 2 Enterprise Edition with BEA WebLogic Server" by
Páco Gomez and Peter Zadrozny.

Test client code is written in the form Java "plug-ins". Sample
plug-ins for testing HTTP and EJB services are provided. It is
particularly suitable for testing BEA WebLogic Server based
applications.


How do I build it?
******************

See the instructions in build.xml.


How do I use it?
****************

Its easy:

	1. Set your classpath to include the grinder.jar file in the
	   lib directory.

	2. Change to a test directory, and set up a grinder.properties
	   file which defines the test you want to perform. See the
	   examples directory for inspiration.

	3. Say
		java net.grinder.Grinder

If you want to use the console, tweak out the following properties	

	grinder.waitForConsoleSignal
	grinder.multicastAddress
	grinder.multicastPort

	grinder.reportToConsole
	grinder.console.multicastAddress.1.1.2
	grinder.console.multicastPort

and say
	java net.grinder.console.Console


How do I fix it?
****************

Please send bug fixes and enhancements you make to paston@bea.com.

BEA keeps me very busy so the timeliness and quality of any email
support I provide will vary.


How do I use the HTTPS plugin?
******************************

1) Install JSSE1.0.2. See
   http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/INSTALL.html

2) In your grinder.properties, use the HttpsPlugin rather than
   HttpPlugin:

	grinder.plugin=net.grinder.plugin.http.HttpsPlugin

3) You can then use https:// in your URLs

	grinder.plugin.parameter.url0=https://localhost:7002/snoop
	grinder.plugin.parameter.ok0=Requested URL:

4) If you want two-way authentication, add the following lines

	grinder.plugin.parameter.clientCert=./philclient.p12
	grinder.plugin.parameter.clientCertPassword=acrobat

	(export p12 from netscape)

The JSSE SSL implementation isn't quick. This should be taken into
account when comparing round trip times, as a compiled browser version
is likely to be a *lot* faster.


What can I set in grinder.properties?
*************************************

[This is not complete - volunteer work required!]

    grinder.jvm.path	-	Specifies the java executable used for
				the child JVMs. Defaults to "java" so
				you do not need to specify this if
				your path is sensible.

    grinder.jvm.classpath -	Use to adjust the classpath used for
				the child VMs. Anything specified here
				will be prepended to the classpath
				used to start the grinder itself.

    grinder.jvm.arguments -	Additional arguments to child JVM's.
