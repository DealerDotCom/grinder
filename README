The Grinder is a pure Java load-testing framework that is freely
available under a BSD style open-source license. It was originally
developed for the book Professional Java 2 Enterprise Edition with BEA
WebLogic Server by Paco Gómez and Peter Zadrozny.

Philip Aston took ownership of the code and reworked it to create The
Grinder 2. Philip continues to enhance and maintain The Grinder.

The Grinder 3 introduces a Jython scripting engine enabling powerful,
expressive test scripts to be executed.

The Grinder's home page is http://grinder.sourceforge.net. This site
contains the latest version of the user manual for The Grinder. A copy
of the user manual is shipped with the standard distribution and can
be found in the docs directory.

The site also contains details of mailing lists that you might like to
join. In particular, if you have questions that are not answered by
the documentation, try asking at grinder-use@lists.sourceforge.net
