What is it?
***********

The Grinder is a simple, pure Java load-testing framework released
under the GNU Public License. It was originally developed for the book
"Professional Java 2 Enterprise Edition with BEA WebLogic Server" by
Páco Gomez and Peter Zadrozny.

Test client code is written in the form Java "plug-ins". Sample
plug-ins for testing HTTP and EJB services are provided. It is
particularly suitable for testing BEA WebLogic Server based
applications.


How do I build it?
******************

You should be able to build the Grinder by doing the following:

       1. Set/export JAVA_HOME to point to a JDK

       2. ./build.sh (or build.cmd)

       3. ./build.sh javadoc (or build.cmd javadoc)


How do I use it?
****************

Its easy:

	1. Set your classpath to include the grinder.jar file in the
	   lib directory.

	2. Change to a test directory, and set up a grinder.properties
	   file which defines the test you want to perform. See the
	   examples directory for inspiration.

	3. Say
		java net.grinder.Grinder

If you want to use the console, tweak out the following properties	

	grinder.waitForConsoleSignal
	grinder.multicastAddress
	grinder.multicastPort

	grinder.reportToConsole
	grinder.console.multicastAddress.1.1.2
	grinder.console.multicastPort

and say
	java net.grinder.console.Console


How do I fix it?
****************

Please send bug fixes and enhancements you make to paston@bea.com.

BEA keeps me very busy so the timeliness and quality of any email
support I provide will vary.
