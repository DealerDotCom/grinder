What is it?
***********

The Grinder is a pure Java load-testing framework that is freely
available under a BSD style open-source license. It was originally
developed for the book "Professional Java 2 Enterprise Edition with
BEA WebLogic Server" by Paco Gómez and Peter Zadrozny. Philip Aston
took ownership of the code and reworked it to create The Grinder 2.
Philip continues to enhance and maintain The Grinder.

Test client code is written in the form Java "plug-ins". Sample
plug-ins for testing HTTP services are provided. It is particularly
suitable for testing BEA WebLogic Server applications.

A JUnit plugin is also supplied. This opens up interesting
possibilities for bake testing Java code to discover race conditions
and other bugs.
