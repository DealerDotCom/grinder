The Grinder sometimes reports negative transaction times
********************************************************

 Are you running linux kernel 2.2.18? Mikael Suokas reports:

   In some load situations, on some hardware, older linux kernels can
   generate system times that jump backwards. I have experienced this
   problem on one machine (Intel Pentium/150, 128M RAM, Adaptec
   AHA-2940, SCSI disks) running the stock Red Hat Linux 7.0 kernel
   (2.2.16).

   The grinder occasionally reported negative response times in the
   -900 to -700 ms range whenever the load became high. Interestingly,
   the same OS+kernel version on several other machines never showed
   these negative response times.

   The problem was not Grinder or Java specific: a C program polling
   gettimeofday() also showed system time jumping backwards.

   Upgrading to kernel 2.2.19 fixed this issue for me. Since the
   release notes for linux 2.2.18 mention timekeeping locking fixes, I
   don't think that was a coincidence.

   Of course, you should upgrade any 2.2.x kernel to 2.2.19 anyway,
   because because of the many security fixes.
