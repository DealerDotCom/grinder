This file contains notes about problems (with some solutions) that
have been reported by users of The Grinder.


The Grinder sometimes reports negative transaction times
********************************************************

 Are you running linux kernel 2.2.18? Mikael Suokas reports:

   In some load situations, on some hardware, older linux kernels can
   generate system times that jump backwards. I have experienced this
   problem on one machine (Intel Pentium/150, 128M RAM, Adaptec
   AHA-2940, SCSI disks) running the stock Red Hat Linux 7.0 kernel
   (2.2.16).

   The grinder occasionally reported negative response times in the
   -900 to -700 ms range whenever the load became high. Interestingly,
   the same OS+kernel version on several other machines never showed
   these negative response times.

   The problem was not Grinder or Java specific: a C program polling
   gettimeofday() also showed system time jumping backwards.

   Upgrading to kernel 2.2.19 fixed this issue for me. Since the
   release notes for linux 2.2.18 mention timekeeping locking fixes, I
   don't think that was a coincidence.

   Of course, you should upgrade any 2.2.x kernel to 2.2.19 anyway,
   because because of the many security fixes.

400 Bad Request responses
*************************

 Phil Aston reports:

   When using the sniffer between mozilla and WLS 5.1 sp10 and sending
   a POST, mozilla often sends the data in a separate packet. This
   _sometimes_ causes WLS to respond with a bad request. I think its a
   WLS 5.1 bug (doesn't happen with WLS 6.1) but can't figure out what
   tickles it. A sequence of seemingly identical messages work, then
   the last one fails. Doesn't seem to be related to concurrency. Can
   step through it slowly, over the same connection, and still have
   the problem. This should go away when we change the sniffer filters
   to be stream oriented, because the packet splitting will then
   change.
